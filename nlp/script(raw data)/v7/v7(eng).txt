virtualization concept we have already discussed some of these aspects in our previous lectures
but i thought that we will have some few more slides on it ah one of the core concept so
virtualization is one of the core ah concept or one of the core prime mover or having these
cloud computing for which the cloud computing is existing today and if you see this virtualization
is not a new concept it is already there we many of our are used to virtualize we virtualize
a a linux system over a window system a window system over a linux system so i have a some
sort of a virtual realization of the things right
and if you look at that other end we are used to different other resources like networking
etcetera so i have a we can have a virtual lan or v lans which is pretty popular which
we have ppn virtual private networks and so and so forth so virtualization is there and
this cloud computing architecture technology tries to exploit this a feature for giving
different services of cloud so as as we have seen this iaas or infrastructure has a service
so from the subscriber point of view what what the subscriber gets so access to virtual
computers right network accessible virtual storage network infrastructure components
like firewall configuration services etcetera so as as if i i being a subscriber i get access
to a virtual machine right or set of machines and then i may want that particular machine
ah with particular storage and other configurations so i dont know where it is how it is configured
but for me if through this particular that interface it is it is a type of machines which
i am looking for even it is it is possible that i i have a combination of this virtual
machines along with a particular backbone network and realize a a network infrastructure
for my purpose right so this is this is that what subscriber gets for me and how uses and
what i pay for it is basically typically per cpu hour gb data stored may be on a hourly
basis network bandwidth consumed on a particular rate network infrastructure used that how
much ip address which are the routers etcetera and value added there can be value added services
like i monitoring automatic scaling and type of things are the things which are value added
services so providers theoretically have a large pool
of virtual machines that means if i am a cloud service provider i say that these are my flavors
of virtual machines which are i am having at my thing right ah and then i i say that
if you want a set of virtual machine then i go on ah provisioning it right and usually
these are into different categories though theoretically i can configure any of the virtual
machine but in practical sense it is it is under with specific configuration and etcetera
like i say that i have vm with very low things like in case of a incase of our meghamala
iit kharagpur we have a virtual three three type of virtual machines one is iit kgp small
vms which has a four gb ram with twenty gb ah hard disk space and these are the other
processing etcetera we have a iit kgp large which has a eight gb ram and so on and so
forth which have a we we have a iit kgp extra large which has a sixty gb ram say these are
the three flavor now based on that based on my backbone resource
availability i have a mix and match of the things not only that the type of vms i will
have is also dependent on type of request i get on this vms right if i have a heavy
request on only the smaller type of vms then i want to provision that smaller type of vm
much more than the higher things and so and so forth so these are the considerations which
come into play right so like in this case a has a access to vm one to vm two right whereas
b has a access to vm three where the client c has a access to v m four to v m six where
the providers retains vm seven through vmn for its other users so that can be that can
be ah a modeled and go on doing that and this these are typically done like that so ah so
if you look at the iaas component stack and scope of control iaas components stack comprises
of hardware operating system middleware and applications layer so these are the typical
thing so operating system is built into two layers lower the most privilege layer so if
we look at the more code to the operating system is occupied by the virtual machine
monitor or vmm which is also called the hypervisor right higher layer is occupied by the operating
system running within the vm called a guest operating system
so the as we have seen that ah we have a like in this case in the middle if you see that
i have the bare metal hardware where the cloud provider have a total control cloud subscriber
has practically low control over that i we have a hypervisor right or vmm or virtual
machine monitor where the administrative control of the cloud provider are cloud subscriber
can basically request a request for vm etcetera to this hypervisor and then ah we have other
layers like guest os middle ware like java etcetera application like mail and crm and
other type of things where the subscriber has the total control in case of a iaas where
the provider does not have any control or does not provider does not control it ah for
the thing right so this is the way it goes on so if we ah if we look at it the type of
control at the upper layers are moved to the subscriber and type of control at the lower
layers are moved to the provider side so in iaas cloud provider maintains total
control over the physical hardware and administrative control over the hypervisor layer subscriber
control the guest os middleware and the application layers which are which over the subscriber
subscriber is free using providers utility to load any support operating system ah things
so if the if the provider ah provides the support the subscriber can load any guest
os subscriber typically maintains complete control over the operation of the guest operating
system in each vm so though the subscriber once it loads it has the total control over
the guest os like if i if if the cloud provider is providing me some linux os and hypervisor
an allows me to load linux or windows etcetera so if i load some flavor of linux then i have
a total control over that particular thing iaas components stack and other thing the
hypervisor uses hardware to synthesis one or more virtual machines or vms is an efficient
isolated duplicate real machine subscriber rents access to vm the vm appears to be subscriber
as actual computer hardware that can be administered that is powered on off peripherals configures
via commands send over the network etcetera so that it it because what i am having as
a subscriber is primarily interface with the provider and i can go on communicating with
that so typically if you look at a typical architecture
so there are several components over at the top is the cloud manager there are different
cluster managers which are which are at the second level of the things and below that
is the computer ah manager or cms right and the cm is basically at the has this hypervisors
and different type of virtual machine immolated over the things right so we have at the cloud
manager and the data object storage which is the muster data base of keeping track of
the things then at the lower level we have a persistent local storage like so that means
hm the storage which does not go have a when the cloud provider is not there when the vms
are ah not used or shut down and type of things so if we look at that three level hierarchy
of the components h have one is the top level is responsible for the central control like
the cloud manager the middle level is responsible for management of the management of possibly
large computer cluster and may be geographically distance from one another so if you look at
this cluster manager it is it is it is managing this large clusters which maybe geographically
spread and the third is the bottom is responsible for running the host computing system on which
virtual machines are created so these are running this host computing system where the
vms are created right so this is typically three layer of control subscriber quarries
and comment generally flow into the system at the top are forwarded down through the
layers which either answer quarries or execute commands
so iaas cloud architecture ah cloud manager can be geographically distributed within a
cluster manager computers manager is connected by a high speed network so this is this ah
if you look at the cluster manager these are all connected through a high speed ah network
so now if you look at the quickly that operation of the different things so what we have cloud
manager at the top then the cluster manager then the computer manager which manages the
individual things right so if you look at the cloud manager duty is the public access
point of the cloud that is the first thing so whenever somebody access the cloud in the
public where the subscriber sign in for accounts manage and resources they rent from the cloud
etcetera cloud manager has the mechanism authenticating the subscriber whether the authentication
mechanisms generating or validating access credential with the subscriber when the communication
with the vms like when it it is basically the of the whole system top level resource
management so for subscriber request cloud manager determines if the if the cloud has
enough free resource or to satisfy the thing so subscriber resource on the things so cloud
manager maintains a meta data information so if i request for a particular vm or a set
of vms which are not available on the cloud then it becomes a ah the cloud manager has
to take a call so it is a it is it manages at the subscriber level there is a thing called
data object storage or dos dos generally store the subscriber metadata as we are talking
about the user credential operating system etcetera dos devices usually single ah is
single for a cloud so what we say that the particular dos service
is for a particular cloud so it a it maintains a ah what we say registry or a cataloging
or a metadata service for that whole cloud so it is the binding block of the ah of the
whole thing that what are the services available whether the free resources available etcetera
are all updated in the those so if we look at the cluster manager that this ah middle
level so it is responsible for operation of collection of computers that are connected
via high speed local area network right so that is the ah it manages the lower level
computers cluster manager receive resources allocation commands and quarry from the cloud
manager at the top and calculate whether the part or all of a command can be satisfied
using the resource of computers in the cluster that means ah when the cluster manager gets
a request it checks that whether the its available resource with within the cluster whether it
is able to satisfy the things and accordingly it says a appropriate signal to the things
like so that it can accept or cannot accept and type of things cluster manager quarries
the computer manager for the computers in the cluster to determine resource availability
returns message to the cloud manager that mean it it it becomes a it ah middle ware
or a agent between the cluster manager and the cloud manager if the if you look at the
operation there it get the direction for the cloud manager and then instructs the computer
managers to perform resource allocation reconfiguration de allocation of resources and etcetera etcetera
is cluster managers connected to a persistent local storage that means it is the so called
coat uncoat ah non volatile storage when the ah particular virtual machine is ah shut down
deprovision or some issues come ups so that it has a a local storage into the things
so the pls provide persistent ah disk like storage to the virtual machine ok so it is
as if persistent disk like the same things are there so the data when you next time log
in it will be available with you so look at the if we look at the operation of the cloud
manager ah at the lowest level in the hierarchy cloud manager runs on each computer system
uses concept of virtualization to provide virtual machine to the subscriber so cloud
manager is basically providing the ah vms so it is the to the subscriber this providing
vms it is it is responsible for that computer manager maintains status information including
how many virtual machines are running etcetera etcetera so it maintains the status information
as of now how many virtual machines are running also cloud manager uses command interface
to hypervisor to start stop a stop suspend reconfigure virtual machines so it also same
the if there is a need to the ah computer manager so all this what we see is virtualization
place important role right so how this virtualization is made and what are the aspects etcetera
thing we will try to see quickly in the subsequent slides so virtualization is a broad term it
can be a virtual memory it can be virtual network it can be virtual storage etcetera
so anything which can be virtualized is a virtualization aspect our primary focus is
the platform for virtualization right virtualization basically allows one computer to do the job
of multiple computers right by sharing resources of a single hardware across multiple environment
so that is important so that means i have a bare metal then i create different machines
or virtual machines which can cater to the things but at the at the back end my same
bare metal is running now this this becomes a very tricky so because suppose you are running
if you are having the your bare metal on particular ah environment and then you are running one
machine on windows one machine guest os on linux one machine or some other things etcetera
etcetera then there is a problem of issue of how this ah say ah instruction set of this
guest os will be running on the hardware at the end so that there are issues of like that
there are issues of application sizing there are issues when the vm says that i require
more resources or i want to release other things how it manage and so and so forth so
of we look at the hardware so if it is a no virtualize system a single os controls the
all hardware platform resources if it is a virtualization system it takes the possibly
ah it makes it possible to run multiple virtual containers on a single physical platforms
so i can have multiple virtual containers which which can run on or which can be plugged
into a single physical ah infrastructure so ah we are we are somewhat experienced with
this virtualization so virtualization is a way to run multiple operating system and ah
user application on the same hardware so that is virtualize so i can i can have two different
operating system on the same that means i say i virtualized one this os out of this
right so run both windows linux on the left of so
how is it different for dual boot dual boot also we are doing that once windows etcetera
here in case of virtualization this ah different os or all the os s are running ah together
right or simultaneously the oss are completely isolated from each other right they are completely
isolated from each other ah in case of a true virtualization now another ah important aspect
of things which come into play is the virtual machine monitor or hypervisor so a hypervisor
or a virtual machine monitor runs the guest os directly on the cpu right so that means
i have a guest os and i am i at the at the ah as my which has been immolated or installed
by the ah subscriber or running on the or its application on the of the client and then
the hypervisor is responsible to execute this or ah run this guest os directly on the hardware
at the back and the things so this works if the guest os uses the same instruction set
of the os host os right if it is a different instruction set then there is a instruction
translation should come into play right so there are several issues as as depicted by
popek and goldberg that three goals of virtual machine architecture are there one is that
equivalence the vm should be indistinguishable from the underlying hardware so as if the
virtual machine is running on the hardware itself so what we say it is equivalence or
resource control the vm should be incomplete control of the virtualize resource
so if you give me four gb machine thirty gb sixty gb hard disk and so and so forth that
i should have to complete control over the thing right as a subscriber and efficiency
most vm instruction should be executed directly ah on the underlying cpu without involving
the hypervisor so that that is another thing so efficiency will increase if the most of
the virtual machine instruction should able to execute directly on the underlying cpu
without intervention of this other involvement the hypervisor so these are the aspects which
need to be looked into when we have virtual machine monitor or hypervisor influence which
allows me to emulate vms so again in the same ah work these popek and goldberg describe
and also give a provided a formal proof of the requirement of the cpus instruction set
to allow these properties to happen like to allow truly virtualization happen at the iaas
level the main idea is classifying these instruction into three different thing one is privileged
instruction which ah which cause a trap in the executed in the user mode there is a sensitive
instruction which ah change the underlining resources that is doing io ah or changing
the fact that the guest os is running on the bare metal etcetera a sorry ah means first
of all changing the io or the page page tables or observe the information indication on the
current privilege level so if you if you remember you are operating ah if you are basic architecture
things so i have different level of operations like level zero level one and so and so forth
so more the lower the level as i go more on the more closer to the bare metal so it all
depends that your virtualization at which point it operates more the higher level then
more latency will come into play more translation will come into play so we need to look into
the things that what level operations i need to do specially when we do iaas type of ah
operations and the former class of sensitivity instructions
also called controls sensitive or latter call are behavior sensitive operations right so
what ah this popek and goldberg so that if we can run a virtual machine with all the
three desired property if the sensitive instruction are a subset of a privilege instruction in
their work they have shown that ah this sort of things are true and we can realize a true
virtual machine so the same thing ah or thus whatever we are discussing so we have this
vms and this hardware over this this virtual machine monitors is running and its allows
us to emulate this different ah vms right so it can be your ah so some where other this
whatever the guest os running on the vm the instruction set need to be converted which
can be understood by this hardware right so that is the our bottom line so whether it
is whether the whole vmm will have a total abstraction or also have some sort of ah overlapping
with the things ah that that depends on whatever the implementation
so if we look at the approaches typical approaches to virtualization so if you see the evolution
of this virtualization one is what we say first general a first generation or full virtualization
so binary rewriting so it is software base vmware and microsoft supports this so whatever
the virtual machines are generating a dynamic translator rewrites to the ha underlining
hardware and so and so forth in case of a second generation virtualization or para virtualization
cooperative virtualization so it is a cooperative virtualization the guest os or the is modified
and vmware xen as it so it basically if you look at here so it penetrates little bit into
the vm that means that is modified on the things in case of a third generation or what
we say silicon based that is hardware assisted virtualization unmodified guest vmware and
xen on the virtual aware ah on the virtualization aware hardware platform so now your hardware
platform is a virtualization aware so it is hardwared hardware assisted virtualization
so in this cases this hardware platforms are not aware of this virtualization whatever
is done done by this your hypervisor so there are ah different things in in case of full
virtualization for generation offering so dynamic binary translation of the source code
as we have seen all the hardware is emulated including the cpu to popular open source emulator
many of you might have seen qemu and bochs these are the two popular emulator which ah
change that open source full virtualization there are advantages of emulation layer like
you dont bothered about that two things are separated ah total vm portability like i can
put take the vm from one to another so put total portability because only the vmm i need
to understand those there are drawbacks this hardware emulations comes with a performance
vice whenever you want to emulate a hardware etcetera performance vice in traditional x
eight six architecture os kernels expect to run on the privilege ring zero and now you
want to run them at a higher level and that that need to be there should be more latency
and other things come into play so we need to pay for that or what we need
to there is a performance price for that things in case of para virtualization guest os is
modified and thus run kernel level operating system at ring one or ring three that is much
higher level guest is fully aware of how to process privileged instruction privilege instruction
translated to vmm is no longer necessary guest operating systems uses specialized api to
talk to the vmm right so it is para that means your vmm is penetrating to use some sort of
a some into the ah ah your ah vms so that now it is not full translation but i have
a para virtualization the performance increases and this things is becoming pretty popular
so in case of para virtualization recompiling of the os kernel is required because there
is penetrating into the things installing of para virtualized drivers are required so
that it it takes care at your guest os level the third one is a hardware os running on
a ring zero vmm uses processor extensions like in case of intel vt or amd v and type
of things to interpret the privileged things hardware assisted virtualization ah removes
many problems that take place in writing a vmm into a writing a vmm into a rather it
is a big challenge so that it is hardware assistant so that means you go directly over
thing is totally fully compiled in doing so you lose that portability of the vms right
it becomes a more tricky issue because you need to migrate to something which understand
that hardware pros it allows run unmodified os right you the oss need to not be modified
cons is the speed and flexibility is issues that when that your flexibility you lose and
the speed it depends when the migration etcetera comes into play so with that we will we will
just touch upon some of the one more aspects of the things what we say network level virtualization
so that now what we are tooking as the hardware now we are looking at the network level that
means i need to emulate a network over a virtual network over a given network right so typical
approaches what we have ah seen is that ah in case of a network technology that is whether
ip base or atm base layer which layer of virtualization is there there are architectural domain like
network resource managements spawning network and type of things level of virtualization
which is node level or full virtualization of the things like ah if you look at suppose
i have i have a network like this then i can emulate a virtual network like this or i can
emulate a virtualize network like this right so this is my base network so it i can have
two type of virtual network on the thing over and above of this thing so i emulate ah a
ah virtual network why to virtualize now ah what people say that ah not only internet
in your own networking paradigm is becoming paralyze like you dont have much in go space
hard to come with a one size fit all type of architecture in number of cases like you
have a network configuration and fits everybody so why not to create something that all sizes
fit to one instead type of scenario so that is the ah things what we want to do so testbed
for future and there is that is and any futuristic working on the network protocols and etcetera
require a testbeds for that putting a whole networking things may be a challenge so i
can have a ah sort of a virtualize network and ah this is not suddenly came into play
we have lot of things which are already in play that is a virtual private network active
and programmable networks overlay networks these are already in place for ah several
years and this is being emulated over that and if you look at there are different type
of aspect like business model architecture design principle design goals and those are
the things and there are different aspects of those ah like infrastructure providers
service providers end user brokers these are the different players and they have a very
ah complex relationship between ah between each other that how things will be there and
this business model is not only true for network virtualization it is true for other sort of
virtualization as well and if we look at that architecture so if
i have that infrastructure provider then i have a service provider one which is have
some sort of a virtual network emulated from this like making active some of the networks
etcetera and i can have other type of service provider two sp two emulating other type of
networks as well so i can emulate different variety of network on a basic underlying network
so i can realize different networks into the things so so these are also becoming very
popular so having say not only having servers like i want to conduct a particular testing
over across the ah across ah across the geographical space so not only i want this servers into
the ah place i also have a particular network infrastructure into play right then those
ah then if you want to have those type of things then i not only require the virtualization
at the iaas level or the server level virtualization i also require a network level virtualization
into play and making this overall i can have a virtualized ip infrastructure into place
right so we will continue our ah discussion in in in our subsequent lectures ah we will
stop here today thank you

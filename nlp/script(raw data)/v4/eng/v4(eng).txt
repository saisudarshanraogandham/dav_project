different aspects of the cloud computing today we will look at or we will start with cloud
computing architecture right what are we will start with the basic introduction and we will
go to more details in todays or subsequent lectures so if we look at these high level
architectural approach or high level view of this things so what we have at the at the
end of the things what we are looking for one is that from the ah user prospective or
overall cloud computing it is we want to achieve some ah business goal right it can be business
goal with respect to consumers it can be business goal with respect to the producer or it may
be the overall frame work of the cloud computing right
so ah some of the business goals is the major thing we are next we have the quality attributes
and then the architectural tactics or the basic architectural frame work so if you look
at that ah business goal at the top of the thing what we looking for primarily we are
looking for some t c o like what is the total cost to the organization who are the stake
ah what about the stake holder satisfaction ah compliance with different standards market
shares flexibility etcetera so this is the overall business goal from the c s p point
of view and to achieve this business goal we have few more parameters we need to be
looked into or which are which need to be monitored measured and what we mean to say
that need to be managed properly is that ah issue of availability elasticity interoperability
security adoptability performance usability and maintainability
now if you if you look at this ah if you ah just go back in one or two lectures where
we started with the basic definition of cloud computing so we were looking for these aspects
of the things like that whether how much available how it is elastic how what a interoperability
so these are major what we say major characteristics of the ah cloud so this this characteristics
basically allows a service provider to define his business goal ah across these different
cloud market and finally in order to achieve this different ah measured services or the
business goals we need to have basic architectural techniques or architectural ah view
so ah like there were the considered essentials are whether it is a stateless design whether
we it whether we loosely coupled right what we are thinking that there are there are several
devices which ah which are geographical is spread so they may be loosely coupled hetrogenious
need to be what we want to bring into the thing is a some sort of a ah interconnect
and homogeneity between the things over broad network access right so what is the caching
mechanism so claim what should be the authentication whether it is claim based authentication then
there are several tied several other aspects of the architectural techniques
now if you look at this sort of things somewhere other are manifested at at any type of ah
service model like if i say infrastructural service model so some aspects will come into
play if i say ah paas some other aspects will come into play and we saas or any other type
of model
so this ah becomes important keep in mind while ah while developing proposing any architectural
view so with this respect or with keeping this in view we see that ah what are the ah
basic consideration to have in this cloud architecture so if you look at the major building
block of cloud computing architecture one is that technical architecture right structuring
according to the xaas stack right adopting cloud computing paradigms structuring cloud
services and components ah middle ware and communication and management and security
so this are more technically ah architect ah technical feature of the architectural
things
there are some of the things which are deployment operation architecture right like geo location
check right i may ah i may want to say that due to my federal requirement all my data
all my applications for my any type of government type ah government related activities should
be within the territory of the country right i do not force for any application or any
data outside the things like if i am having a mail service the mail data mail server etcetera
should reside within the ah geographically bounded area of the of our nation so that
might be a thing there are there there may be other legal issues etcetera and there are
deployments issues like operation and monitoring so what should be the operational view how
it will be monitored how this xaas stacks looked in to those are the other deployment
operation architecture
so if you ah if you look at this typical xaas thing so what w have at the down is this infrastructure
as a service then platform as a service software as a service this is the typical stack of
the or typical or most popular xaas excess a xaas applications or services now if you
look at the ah this architectural side of the things or the ah basic building block
so down the line is more of a storage and infrastructure so ah this is that is the colour
in the blue up in the thing is the application this right and there are the client infrastructure
which interacts with this application in between is the middle where or what we say that the
platform or the platform as the service take obtained where the services cloud runtime
libraries and other things come out
so any any realization of any cloud computing ah infrastructure whether it is a public private
ah open source customized we need to look in to some where other is broadly has to have
these type realization and if we look as ah view of consumer versus providers or the customer
versus provider so there are ah again for the iaas again this is primarily important
for i t architect in the i t operation type of things for the end user or or the application
user that is more important is the application user application administrator etcetera which
howards around the top of the things like one of the popular things eg application may
be the c r m right and where as for the software architect developer which which comes in the
middle which uses this hardware infrastructure or which is uses this infrastructure as a
service develop something and which are deployed or put support to these application above
this
so these are the this categories like in the ah in the middle of the things so different
people or different category of users are different view of this architecture right
now we just try to map that ah with this our very two popular one of means two popular
cloud services there are several other popular services but these are the things which are
available on the which will put to get so one is the microsoft windows azure platform
another is the amazon cloud platform or amazon e c two
now look at that also divided into more or less in the that three stack right this is
as more at the bottom of the things same as the incase of e c two ah in case of amazon
it is windows servers and ah related stuff where is in case of e c two it is it can be
windows linux infrastructure along with s three ah amazon s three ah and simple dv and
other type of storage and in between we are having this ah this middle where which emulates
the platform this is as a analog of stuff there and at the top it has the applications
right right ah this are some of the windows azure applications and these are the ah amazon
applications and here the client can connect through ah either in case of a client this
is silver light in case of this or ah we can connect it through the browser
so one thing i just look like to mention ah it was there in the previous slide also there
are two article stack right what we say ah management and security right this is important
because this management and security issues sometimes people who want to put the security
is also a management aspect and sometimes we have other aspects like what we say quality
of services so management quality of services and security in some in some of the references
or metriasys you will find that so all this are these are the scenarios where these are
the stack which goes vertical that means it cannot be it i cannot achieve security or
management taking only one layer at a thing
so it is it is it requires some sort of a cross layer considerations that is why these
are vertical stacks and if you see the same thing ah in case of a case of these ah azure
or e c two so these are also we have these vertical stacks right so they have different
component of security relevant component of management but these goes on the vertical
stack similarly ah the security aspect is based on the we see later on based on how
much control we are having goes on to things like if i am if i am having infrastructure
as a service so my security or management is more consideration on the ah as a infrastructure
so ah so once i rollout this infrastructure one i vision this infrastructure actual machine
etcetera so that is the responsibility of the user or the consumer to look in to the
thing if i having a up to a software as a service then all these issues are need to
be provided up to that layer right so a say a a what put processing service or c r m service
which is a software service so ah all aspects up to that level of management and security
it will provided so that it depends that what sort of service provisioning or the what sort
of ah service deployment we are doing for this ah particular ah particular scenario
there are several aspects or issues as we are talking about one is elasticity as we
are mentioned or as we are know ah that elasticity is one of the most important characteristics
of cloud like if i if i scale up scale down into my ah in to this computing parodied now
in order to achieve that so there can be two broad approaches right so this is this two
broad approaches ah which is two when without cloud also it is more of a elastic computing
when do one is that i can one i can do it vertical scale up that means at more resources
to the box right we have a particular infrastructure say for for example i have a particular rack
with different servers so we initially we are having say i am having some twenty four
servers then i scale up putting more server in to the things or my chases may be holding
sixteen blades and having initially four based on the requirement i the organization feels
that the requirement go go on another four or up to a sixteen blade chases ah like full
fully loaded chases now this is vertically going up right
so this is ah has advantage where for in case of a small scenario scale up is probably cheaper
ah so that it works just you be put on the things right so add more resources to a single
computational box and move the work load to the computation unit to more resources so
i i have more resources whereas ah when we have scenarios where for larger scenario scale
out scale out is only solution one is to sixty four way server is much more expensive than
sixty four into one way server right so having say sixty four of one unit computational power
and trying to achieve realize a sixty four computational units is much cheaper than having
a six one unit of sixty four ah computation
so what is happening that when i have a large scale scenario then expanding in that fashion
may be pretty costly ah so in that cases not only expanding in terms of cost ah in terms
of only financial aspects it is maintainability rate of failure may be pretty high like a
one ah if the single system it is a single point of failure at time where as i if i have
a multiple systems so that if an ah if some systems fails then i can have a way to work
on in a ah little lower performance metric but i can work out the things
so this becomes whether it is a horizontal scale up or scale out or it is a vertical
scale out we need to consider based on my our requirement now ah if we ah again come
back to our service model so xaas what is happening is the combination of service oriented
infrastructure or a service oriented architecture on in for realization of infrastructure and
cloud computing realize to a xaas so what is the service oriented architecture ah i
believe most of you are acquire ah already knowing so what will do ah we will have a
some sort of slides on service oriented architecture in ah subsequent lectures so that those who
are not in the ah not hm understand or not ah very much familiar with this type of things
we will have a immediately quick check up
but never the less it is a service driven ah approach for infrastructure or paas or
any type of things right so we are tried to combine s o i and cloud computing to realize
this xaas so anything as a service is a generalization of cloud related services refers to increasing
number of services that are delivered over internet rather than provided locally or on
site xaas is the essence of cloud computing already we know
so anything as a service so still we seen data is a service another popular we can have
anything other type of services right so as ah some of these popular xaas instance is
one is infrastructure as a service platform software service already known there is another
thing came up what is what is now becoming pretty popular what we say business process
as a service right so or i have a business work flow which want to give as a service
so horizontal or vertical business processes provided on a subscription basis to companies
or industries like suppose for a particular particular ah operation i have a business
process right so what are ah what does it mean it it may not be only one applications
which is delivering the things so i have different processes which has a archaistism between
them then allow me to realize a particular ah applications right it can be for ah something
for the banking sector it can be for some of the aspects of different development planning
operations of the things so it is not only i run a application and get results ah a application
is dependent on other applications another etcetera etcetera
so i have different processes or applications which allows me to realize the thing so it
means as if p one two may lead to something called pue three which can is a input to the
p three and in turn p three and p four will come out with the final outcome of the things
now i have different may be different processes right or ah so these are archaistics in the
things so i can say i have business process which is which is basically division of the
ah or ah amalgamation or integration of the of different sub processes or sub applications
the interesting feature is that there is a timing relationship and a what we say processes
execution tree or process execution graph will be there so that it it follows a particular
things
now for this sort of things if it is a define then whether i can say this i give a service
with a business process everything so it is not now not only the application as a service
or software as a service so i basically have a something more than software as a service
which talks with things incidentally different processes may come from from different heterogeneous
providers so i can basically now interact with or collaborate with different cloud service
providers and then realize the thing
so this business process is important because end of the day specially for the organization
this matters rather ah many of you might have heard there is a very popular language what
we say business process execution language where you can defined what is your business
process of outflow in to the thing and so it realize the thing right so that is one
one of the major aspects so iaas is the raw infrastructure c p u etcetera paas is the
virtualized application development or run time platform saas is the software application
hosted in the cloud provided in a subscription basis and this business process as a service
is a horizontal or vertical business process involved in ah basis ah on a subscription
basis to companies or industries right and if we again little renew so it is something
a tapering thing our popular iaas paas and thing paas are the infrastructure
so other than this three most popular examples we have ah several other ah business process
ah ah several other xaas instances like we have already seen business process as a service
there is storage as a service i can have security as a service like its it provides different
security future as a thing i can have data base as a service right so i do not want to
install etcetera i want to leverage database into a service monitoring management as a
service like i want to manage my i t infrastructure like i want to i have a large say in our i
t infrastructure we have large labs ah which are used by different category different type
of p g u g courses and i want to basically manage the things right like manage the things
upto a starting from software of the means what is the software going on whether they
are michinious basically having any problem from the hardware or type of things different
things so whether i can have i have separate tools or i somebody gives me a service which
connects with this machines and do the things right or any any large infrastructure in case
of a organization
so communication content computing as a service these are the some of the things identity
as a service backup as a service desktop as a service so i can have anything as a service
and these are some of the things which are being used across the world so end of the
day what does c s p or the cloud provider is looking for increase ah productivity end
user satisfaction some innovative ah services so that it has it can hold its market position
and have different intry ah it is ah its infrastructure as a aisle right so it is as aisle and it
can give it is it cores it it can what we say configure it self along with the need
of article
so if we look at this again if we come back to our ah basic definition and try to see
so one is the broad network access resource pooling business driven infrastructure on
demand like what is there and service oriented orientation service oriented architecture
so all this four hills us in realizing this xaas type of services so xaas fulfills all
the four ah typical demands of ah service provider right
now ah like our network stack ah like our t c p i p r o s i models so if i want to have
that what will be the typical classical stack of the things right stack of our service model
or xaas model so at the at the base of the things what ah so it is not like that ah so
it is a what we say logical way of looking at the things right it is not like that ah
that something will done always over the other but it is a logical representation of the
things like at the core of the thing is the networking
so you have a underlining broad network access which allows the things to talk each other
right another core component is the storage it is also something omnipresent other aspect
is the server so if you look at this three stuff are primarily is the major building
block what we say the bear metal things over which it works so one is the communication
one is this ah different servers and other physical infrastructure and other one is the
storage storage always we try to keep it as a separate aspect other than keeping one of
the infrastructure in some of the cases storage are kept as a infrastructure but storage plays
a different type of role storage management is different thing
so that is that those are a important aspects of the ah storage is the input aspect over
that what in order to realize are the things is that is aspect of virtualization right
so i need to virtualize all the things so i can have a virtualization of the whole infrastructure
i can have the virtualization only of the particular behaviour actual missing i kept
even virtualize the network so i have a infrastructure virtualization i want to realize a particular
virtualization network infrastructure and of course storage and there is a virtualization
basically try to have these so called virtual machines or virtual network virtual storage
type of ah stuff over that if it is a virtual machine i need to put the particular o s over
which i should run the thing right or and so this over that this middleware then i have
runtime library the data over for ah which more closely with the application and finally
end of the top of the stack is the applications
so these are the different components which make this iaas that the ah feasible it is
it may be noted that all the components are not equally important ah may not be equally
important for all type of xaas type of thing but never the less they play a important role
in realization of the thing now if we try to because always it hewers that all all we
are some somewhere other we are already getting this stuffs right what is the what is this
big paradise shift right so as such we should ah we have already mentioned in our initial
lectures that already we are ah having distributed systems and other things into place we do
realize lot of things etcetera
so make make it to make it more market viable and having a scalable computing infrastructure
we as you go model measures are so if you look at that a simplified i t i t stack so
we have end user devices application and dedicated infrastructure so this is the in the legacy
i t or still it is very much still it is very much ah present in or rather omnipresent in
various organizations and other type of thing so these are somewhat clipped together right
or more strongly coupled right so that ah dedicated application runs over the applications
dedicating infrastructure so application size seeing etcetera are made based on the infrastructure
or other way around
end user also have a some dedicated application to work with right whereas what we go for
what we are trying to realize is more of a simplified i t infrastructure right where
where these are are little bit flexibilities are maintained so i have some dedicated infrastructure
over application end user devices but they are not very strongly bound so this is the
ah thing what we are going to do and it it is it can be soon also we can since see some
of the subsequent lectures that this sort of things may allow us to have better utilization
of the resources or better return on investment right or having a giving service different
of different type of services on the same type of or a or a common resource based type
of thing
in some of the cases several organizations has several surplus resources like if i talk
again about our own u g or p g labs which may be having huge amount of ah computing
resources but then they may not be utilize across twenty four hours right they are utilized
may be eight to ten hours on a very ah very loaded but out of out of class hours or out
of lab hours the those can be clubbed together to have to give the researchers the opportunity
to run high simulation on the basic ah pc type of platform so that may be one way of
utilizing own resources in a better fashion
so ah there are some of the other things like classical model plus xaas model there are
different aspects like licensed software hardware product and people based services these are
the more popular aspects of our ah traditional cloud right traditional infrastructure models
or classical infrastructure model and we need to make the architecture in such a fashion
that it it maximizes this effort whereas in is our our imagine things we are going to
a xaas type of ah services like so ah that is ah software iaas paas or any any type of
any type of xaas type of services and rather ah if you look at our classical ah thing or
still it is very much valid we have a client server architecture right
so there is a server which serves several clients and based on the server programme
is running on the server and always waiting for the client to connect and we connect to
the thing and this is extremely popular and still very much in the use and will be in
the use in in several cases right that from there we are migrated to a service oriented
architecture so instead of this very strongly craple client server we have service oriented
to it service talks to each other and there are distinct advantages we can have heterogeneous
things to talk to each other and we we have lot of flexibilities
very popular client server things are like f t p server ah telnet s t d p are a way particular
demon of the server part which ah looks into this ah talks to this client so we will we
will carry on our discussion in our ah subsequent ah lectures on this ah particular architectural
aspects of a cloud computing and will also see that different things of virtualization
another thing so to for today we will for now for this lecture we will stop here
thank you

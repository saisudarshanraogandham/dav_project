discussion on ah on cloud architecture and specially see some aspects of a cloud taken
is cloud like one of the aspects is virtualization right so as if we if we look at remember that
are there lectures we are discussing on different type of a service models and also we have
different type of deployment models in cloud namely public private hybrid and ah community
cloud different aspects and all all sort of services can be hosted in different type of
deployment models right
so in case of a public cloud ah the as the name suggests it is available for public at
large so it is it is ah you anyone can purchase that and it is somewhat omnipresent across
the internet right some of the very popular examples are ah google app engine microsoft
azure ibm cloud amazon ec two and many others right many many others clouds are there right
so what happened that we have this public cloud and enterprise or individual can subscribe
this public cloud right subscribe this public cloud over the internet and can have that
ah its services over this in so the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use
by general public ah organization enterprises and anyone who can pay and use the things
there are definitely some ah legal policies we need to be conformed too so it may be owned
managed and operated by a business academics government organization or some combination
of them right it exists in the premise of the cloud provider
so typically the physically the public cloud is at the csps premise or premises right so
that means ah that means ah whatever the computing infrastructure storage infrastructure and
other type of things are there those are residing in the csps ah of the cloud providers premises
not at the ah private or not at the users premises so that is one one aspects of the
thing and ah in public in public setting providers computing and storage resources are potentially
large right so it it is serving to all communication links can be assumed to be implemented over
public internet services and the cloud service serves a diverse pool of client and may be
out of them do not all faithful clients there can be some attackers hackers etcetera ecetera
so it is it is open to anybody who can subscribe a typically it can have a service provider
and you can ah there can be different type of users at the things right so what are the
typical features workload locations are hidden from the cloud one one of the clients that
is one of the ah major thing like you dont know where the where your virtual machine
is you dont know where the where your actually the data is residing which server which location
and with whom it is residing so it is it is all are hidden so as for as as if you you
are not very stringent on the legal and policy matter about the security and other aspects
though it is fine that you dont care so long your services are there there are risk from
multi tenancy that means your logically or or it may be ah theoretically always possible
that you are computing your storage where it is residing somebody elses things are there
now if it is your somebody ah with some organization or some person who is who is not very faithful
or we are not very comfortable so that two things two some two different user can reside
ah can work on the same things
so in other sense there is a risk there is this what we say multi tenancy and there are
risks of multi tenancy because i i dont know that where things are there where there though
whether there is a underlining channel to access my data services and other type of
things so there is a risk of ah multi tenancy
so single machine can be shared by workloads by any combination of subscriber subscriber
workload maybe co resident with the workload of the competitor or adversaries right in
ah so it introduce both reliability and security risk so organization considering use of onsite
public cloud should consider network dependency right so whenever suppose iit kharagpur things
that all is ah all is ah or some of his labs will be running on public cloud so that so
that ah our overall maintaining and etcetera reduces cost of maintenance or overall load
on maintenance etcetera reduces
now there one first dependency is the network so it will be always available the network
connectivity should be always available up to a mark so there is one dependency there
are limited visibility and control over the data regarding the security so i has we are
mentioning that i have limited visibility of the ah data i dont where the data is and
how it is secured only thing what i have is a some sort of a sla or some sort of a mou
between the provider and provider and me that this data is secured and so and so forth
so there is a issue of elasticity or illusion of unlimited resource availability right so
ah this is when you use public cloud this is pretty fine because i theoretically i have
infinite amount of elasticity like if i have i if i need more computing power it will be
provision if i one more other storage things it will be provisions when i dont require
i releases it or de provision it so those things are feasible so theoretically infinite
ah scaling up scaling down is possible another important thing is the low upfront
cost to ah migrate into the cloud right so if you want to make a private cloud of your
own then you have to purchase the thing make provision where it will be housed install
software and etcetera run it test it there are issues of maintenance so and so here the
up front there is no there is very low up front cost you pay and use it restrictive
default service service level agreements so there is a now whenever we purchase something
there is a somewhere other we need to confirm to the ah that standard or what we say coat
uncoat restrictive service level agreements between the provider and the consumer
so most of the cases we need to follow the terms and condition ah provided the provide
ah like whatever is given by the provider unless you do for a large scale deployment
where you negotiate at special rate with special sla and type of things right but normally
for a small institution and public at large we need to confirm to the whatever is being
provided
so totally other means the other aspects of the form the public is the private so you
have your own cloud and you have all your resources which can be ah working on it right
so the cloud infrastructure is provision for exclusive use of a single organization comprising
a multiple consumers or business units like a same organization say iit kgp private cloud
my catering all the things which in the iit departments etcetera may be owned managed
and operated by the organization or it can be outsourced by a third party managing resources
out here but it is in your premises under your jurisdiction under your network control
and type of things and it may exist on or off premises also right
so that there are usually on premises or i can say i have a private things or what we
say outsource private cloud ah where i can at the off premises but never the less it
is jurisdiction or my policy stipulated rules or the organization rules which driven so
there are some of the open source and other public cloud one is that eucalyptus pretty
popular there are open stack ubuntu enterprise cloud amazon epc virtual private cloud vmware
cloud infrastructures suite microsoft eci data centers and so on and so forth
so there are several things which gives private cloud into the thing so contrary to popular
belief private cloud may exist off premises and can be managed by third party so i i ah
not only means take the responsibility or i basically i want to maintain the control
over the whole thing but i basically may ah off premise or i installed out with the help
of a third party to a separate thing also right there is two private cloud scenarios
one is on site private cloud which is which is the de facto or which is immediately come
to which comes to our mind when we are talking about anything which is private applies to
private clouds implemented as the customers premises
another is the outsource private cloud like i have a private chunk of the things which
is outside outsource out of my premises but never the less it is private to me right so
applies to private cloud where the server side is outsource to the hosting company wherever
its it is there so in case of on site private cloud the security perimeter extends around
both the subscriber on site resources and private cloud resources so i your security
perimeter or your ah legal control is basically have the encompass the private cloud right
security perimeter does not guarantee control over private cloud resources but the subscriber
can exercise control over the other resources over the resources like so that it it its
a incase of onsite like whatever the private cloud it is there i can have a overall control
over the whole resources of the private cloud
so there are some issues characteristics pros and cons of the maintaining on site private
cloud one is the network dependency on site private right subscriber so it is dependency
on the on your internet network should be here subscriber still needs a it skill i i
my organization is meeting my own cloud or the organization meeting own cloud so there
should be some sort of a skill to maintain that workload location are hidden from the
ah client ah even if my clients are different differ in my subunits that also this is hidden
from the client like even ah if if it is within the premises or ah on site private cloud that
actually infrastructure is hidden from the cloud where client is my own organization
things or or my own clients are on the other side risk from multi tenancy again the same
issues of within things also come into play data import export and performance limitation
there can be issues of data import export because there are lot of data which will be
going out and going down
so that on demand bulk data import export is limited on onsite private clouds network
capacity or real time critical processing maybe problematic because of network limitation
potentially strong security from external threats usually if it is a private within
your network boundary all your network other features come into play like as i was mentioning
in some of my in one of my earlier lecture that iit kharagpur has has installed or has
developed a private cloud for its research purpose what is meghamala but it is within
my network premise so what whatever the network security parameters or features are there
for iit kharagpur is also applied for this infrastructure
so what what happens that it has a potentially strong security features significant to high
upfront cost to migrate into the cloud so that is another issue right whenever you have
a private cloud so there is a significant cost in installing maintaining and there is
may be a significant cost in migrating the whole thing into the private cloud your own
say there is a limited resources all if you have your thing that anything you want to
augment you need to purchase install not only that even to need to properly interoperate
with the existing things right so in doing so you have ah a times you have
a limited resources like ah suddenly i can go up or down on the resources so as onsite
private cloud any specific time has a fixed computing and storage capacity that can be
sized to corresponding correspond to the anticipated work loads and cost so what we do whenever
i i install a private cloud so i i have a estimate of the things like storage computing
etcetera and then keeps some provision like of it is a buying that the staff at x amount
i or i install one point five but ah that is the thing that i am limited to that x one
point five x amount of the thing
so there is another variant of the things i keep this as private but i ah outsource
it so that maintaining installing etcetera i dont ah means organization dont take care
but it is outsource it so outsource without source outsource private cloud has two security
perimeters one implemented by the cloud subscriber whoever is there on the right and the implemented
by the provider so one this is a perimeter so what is happening it has a some sort of
a channel which which connects this to this private cloud which is outsource in some other
premises right or maybe a subset of a cloud service provider right
so i have a channel which hooks into the things but the whole staff at that end is a private
to me right so ah the security of data and processing conducted on the outsource private
cloud depends on the strength and availability of both security perimeters and of the protected
communication so what we require that my infrastructure to be secured at the external things another
the channel where by the network channel or the network communication link which i talk
which over which i communicate or over which my organization communicate with the cloud
should be secured in a in up to a particular level at up to a particular level or expected
level
so there are again some consideration pros and cons of using outsource private cloud
one is network dependency ah that again i am dependent on how things will be connected
workload location are hidden from the client again those type of issues it is from multi
tenancy the where i am hosting my private cloud other people may be hosting also the
private cloud so data import export and performance limitation same thing exist potentially strong
security from external threat because of you have still have a private ah things it is
not fully public and not all people are jumping on your cloud but never the less you are maybe
sharing some infrastructure may be more thereat at the much more ah lower level at the highest
level and so on
but at the higher level you are not a allowing anybody to enter into the things modest to
significant up front costs to mitigate clouds so those are same as whatever we are having
at the things and most of the cases you need to negotiate in terms sla with the provider
who is providing your or the third party who is provide you this cloud extensive resource
availability is maybe an advantage because this is not limited i am taking a chance so
i request for increase it may it is very much possible to increase at the other end provided
the ah provider is not out of resources usually they have lot of resource at their backbone
the so one side is private one side is public another typical type of cloud is community
cloud right so it basically tries to as we have discussed it basically tries to serve
a particular community per say it is usually can operate in a public or private both and
it basically cater to a particular community which has a some some what same domain of
operation or same focus of of ah interoperating right
so cloud infrastructure is provision for a exclusive use of a specific community of consumer
from organization that are shared concerned that means they have a light minded concern
that is there can be same missions security requirement policy compliance consideration
etcetera it may be owned managed operated by one or more organization in the community
so a third party or some combination of that it may exist on or off premises ok so it can
be a on premises off premises there are several ah community cloud and which are being provided
by different service provider
so there are there can be one thing that like there are several abc organization there x
y z organization and there can they can form different set of combinations like abc xyz
can be one community a with x y can be another community and so and so forth so there is
possibility of bringing things together there is also possibility that i a community can
be can be existing as some point of time at the some other point of time it may not existing
i may be a organization can be more than one community of the things like ah like our day
to day life i may be a part of my office group also i am part of my say residential ah community
right
so there can be different policies and etcetera things are there and but it is the the primary
objective is that there are like or same type of concerned or same type of workflow it may
so happened that this community ah making them in a single community will help in productivity
right so ah there are again lot of characteristics pros and cons etcetera the the participant
organization are connected by a links between the boundary controllers and allow access
through their security parameters like whatever the firewall policies or that type of boundary
policies are there access policy of a community cloud may be a pretty complex because you
can have number of community so at way what way access which you dont access whether there
is a leakage of information i get some information someone community pass it to the other community
so these need to be properly restricted
so policy specification techniques like role based access control attribute based access
control are there like based on my role i access some data right and like other form
of deployment models here also we have network dependency subscriber still need some it skills
because he need it need to maintain with ah different community things
workload location are hidden from the client again data import export performance limitations
there are issues on that like how between the community ah things etcetera whether the
data or within the community when multiple subscriber come in to play that how things
will be there and number of cases this communities can be loosely coupled so that things becomes
more critical to manage potentially strong security from the external thing because still
you are in the one community so that you have a better resistance to the external threats
based on your community policies along with your own policy
high variable up front costs to migrate to the cloud so there is a as as we have seen
in case of a truly private cloud there is a high variable upfront cost to the migrate
of the migration to the cloud because it is not publicly available so you need to create
the things and there can be different sort of ah things like there are three organizations
forming a community with a some boundary controller where with a private subscriber and those
issues come into play community cloud can be on the premises or we the community cloud
can be ah out of means premises that means the community cloud can be ah out source as
we have seen that in case of a private cloud
so once we outsource the network dependency workload location are not known or hidden
from the clients risk from multi tenancy data import export and performance limitation issues
this will come into play potentially strong security from external threats as we have
mentioned that is still you are on the community modest to significant upfront cost if it is
outsource there are lot of loads are ah taken up by the outsource this is in organization
so there is a there is a chance that the overall loading maybe overall ah upfront cost will
be much less than if you are maintaining in premises and theoretically if you are outsourcing
extensive resource ah availability are possible so ah apart from this as we can theoretically
see or practically see that i can have a cloud which is combination of all those things right
so i can have private public community things specially with the public private cloud i
can have a cloud which is combination of such ah more than one type of deployment models
the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two more distinct cloud infrastructure
private community or public
so i have three type of things and then i have i i want to realize a cloud which has
a combination of a these three things why this is important first of all its all all
depends that what sort of ah uses pattern i am having like some of the uses pattern
what i am having is more critical or more vulnerable to security threats that i want
to keep as a more private right i dont want to i have a appropriate network ah boundary
or network perimeter security to be implemented on the things there are some of the resources
which may not be i dont i may not want those to be so much secure or i dont care about
all those security of the all those things and that can be made some of the things public
like if i say if there are practice sessions for ah say computing labs for students so
the level of security is much less than the when i am keeping say student records or students
examination things etcetera right so though same type of operations may be there but one
i could have ah gone away with and an outsource this and gone to the public cloud to do it
all right and where as the other one ah even it is economical i want to keep those as my
private things now i I can have a private combinations right as number of cases what
sometimes it happens that you do something with the private and you require some resources
to be provisioned due to sudden increase of the things then suddenly in a private cloud
increasing the resource provisioning or purchasing etcetera is a long process so you purchase
the thing on a public cloud from a from a for a short period of time so long your process
is an place and this goes to the things
so the infrastructure community that remains unique entities but are bounded together in
a standardize or proprietary technology enables data and application to be portable this is
important so portability not only with respect to data whenever i have this private public
community all together or a combination of two or more together then there are the issue
of intra operative come into play like the data which is working fine here when i take
some application from the other whether we still workout the things
so the both data and at times the applications suppose your application was running on a
private cloud with some resources now you provision a vm which basically goes to the
public domain now the type of applications whether the application wants need to be resized
or there are portability issues of the applications need to be looked into so exam there are examples
of hybrid cloud some of the popular windows azure capable of hybrid cloud vmware v cloud
there are capability of hybrid cloud and as i have mentioning that there are several ah
other providers which which helps us in which provide this type of things
so the hybrid cloud is composed of two or more private public etcetera they have a significant
variation in performance reliability security property depending upon the type of cloud
chosen to build a hybrid right if it is a if it is a community cloud or public and etcetera
it will there will be difference in the performance different in the security features etcetera
so a hybrid cloud can be extremely complex that is one one of the major things like suppose
your ah suppose your ah a particular application is going on and need to run over over a combination
of public and private cloud then the overall ah underlining architecture maybe very complex
so that your application runs seamlessly over the things so at times this private clouds
can be extremely complex a hybrid cloud may change over time with constituent clouds joining
or leaving there is another another another big factor so what we are what we are trying
that ah it may so happened that you bind a hybrid cloud with your own private cloud and
two other public clouds right so now what now it may so change that some
of the public cloud may go may wants to disconnect base based on your terms and conditions and
subscription ends they dont want to again resubscribe and they have a different pricing
model even some of the thing may go red right there the organization the cloud may not be
there so in that case your you need to there can be joining leaving and joining of new
things or sometimes you may require more resources so you add some more ah public or community
cloud into the things all this becomes extremely complex phenomena to handle right so that
means over time ah the constituent clouds may leave or joined and making the whole process
pretty complex right
so now ah what should i choose right what should my should be my deployment model is
another ah big question right it all it totally depends on on your requirement like if i have
a small organization or individuals my public cloud may be a good solution so long my business
is not going up front on the ah something which compiles me to go to the to a own private
cloud there are other constant like i I do business for somebody else right i I have
some other subscriber base or client base now this client may be interned looking for
a things like suppose i have a storage provider data storage provider
now i may either i have a all this storages on my premises or i outsource this resources
or provision this resources from other other public clouds now it may be so happened that
the the my clients which may be something miss and critical clients like may be a financial
sector or defense sector they want that no no no it it cannot happen you need to have
your own thing so it all depends that how what should be my way of looking at it right
i can have a combination as we have talking about hybrid i can have a combination of private
public and so forth based on my requirement or whether i can classify my application into
different things my data my applications into different categories and then i say that this
bunch can go to the private this bunch can go to the public this can go to the community
and type of things
so managing all those things is a another big challenge or ah for the organization or
institution to handle that so ah with this we will we close this lecture and we will
continue our lecture on ah other aspects of cloud computing ah in the subsequent talks
thank you

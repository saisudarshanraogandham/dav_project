so where we end in the last talk is where we are talking about the distributed systems
right so i believe that we are we are in this particular site or in this slide why we require
these distributed system so as we were discussing so the nature of the application is one of
the driving force ah performance is another major driving force like like why ah if the
some of the some of the applications some of the requirements are computing intensive
or some of the things can be data data intensive
so this requires requires distributed computing so another aspect is the robustness right
like as we were discussing that there should not be any single point of failure my application
does not want any single point of failure that means always it should be on even at
a low performance level i cannot say it should be a failure in case of a centralized systems
if the system fails everything drops down but in this case we still work on a on the
things
another other nodes can execute the same does executed on the failed nodes so that means
i evolve as a system that if it is a failed then the task which is working on the failed
node can be executed or shared the load by the other node so this type of technology
algorithms are possible to develop or or are being used in case of a distributed systems
so there are several another ah several distributed applications so application that consist of
set of processes that are distributed across network of machines and work together as an
ensemble to solve a common problem
in other sense i have a several applications which coordinate among themselves to address
a particular problem so this this is as if is a group of people working to address a
particular problem this is primarily useful for a large scale application development
or large scale operational need right where you have different operation being serve as
different and we have we realize a a particular overall job that did right so there are not
only computing aspect there are several other aspects into the things as those who have
worked or those who are read either things there are there is a need of or castration
of this processes or castration of the services like who who will do etcetera so we have to
form there so there are different aspects but there is one of the major application
of this type of major application of this type of distributed computing
and ah not only in the past now also ah it is mostly its several application are client
server type of things ah resource management centralized at the server so we which want
to make it an a distributed fashion there are peer to peer computing which represents
a movement towards truly distributed applications right so there are other other type of ah
motivating forces or motivating motivations towards the distributed system so this is
typically clients invoke individual servers we are ah we are used to that like client
invoke ah a particular server ah so invocation and results the sever can as a client for
another server right and there are there be can be there so i can say that all those things
works in a individually may be clients sever more but they are basically trying to realize
a overall particular job
so i can have a typical distributed application based on peer processes so there are different
peers there are different applications which are running in the peers and ah it can so
happen that the this applications talk to each other to realize to realize a particular
job right so there are application based on this peer processes so another so these are
different type of distributed computing paradigm another computing paradigm which ah became
popular rather still it is a it is very much popular is the grid computing right
there are again different definition of grid computing and if you look at some of them
so a form of networking ah unlike conventional network that focus on communication among
devices grid computing harnesses unused resource cycle of a of all computers in the network
can solve problems intensive for standalone systems so that means i have a network of
system much stronger couple solved some particular problems so if you look at other type of grid
computing enables virtualization of distributed computing and data resources such as processing
network bandwidth storage capacity to create a single system image granting user and application
seamless access to the vast it applications
this is another important way of looking at it that means i have a distributed computing
paradigm and then i want to realize or virtualize another system over the things right which
which is one of the prime over of this cloud computing paradigm right i have a several
systems over the network they have different processes etcetera then i want to have a a
system evolved out of the things like i or popularly i can say that its a i want to ah
have one or more virtual machines with defined resources based on my requirement right this
is one way of a looking at it
so there are the these are the ah different aspect and then grid computing is a computing
infrastructure that provides dependable consistent pervasive inexpensive access to computing
capability in other sense i have a resources which are ah available on the network and
one popular things what we have in our day today life is or hear about the things or
experience the thing is the electrical grid right so one good analogy is an electrical
grid so electrical grids are running and we tap power we in the sense that organizations
or households or the power distribution systems step power from the grid so its a it something
a available so in case of a you can have a ah computing analogies like users or client
applications gain access to the computing resources processors storage data applications
so on as needed with little or more no knowledge of where those resources are located
that means i its a its a way of looking i have resources i tap those resources and use
it for my thing say i i want to run something on a computing grid so i am more bothered
about my own algorithm methodology and i what i think that what is the resource requirement
now if i that particular grid particular computing grid allows me so i need to hook into the
grid and run the resources ah run the my a program or my run my processes and it it detunes
some the resources so the grid links together computing resources like pc workstation etcetera
and provides the mechanisms needed to accessing
so if i have agreed so what i require from the user point of view a mechanism access
this grid so if you look at grid computing characteristics so say are more than information
it is not only information it is something data computing per so and so efficient use
of resources at many organization or institutes so i can have a efficient use of resources
like if you look at our typical computing lab of a ug pg classes they accept the lab
classes as they are mostly underutilized so i i could have form a computing grid during
the of a piece hours specially of academic hours so that other researches could have
used as the ah as as a computing platform so my pcs set of hundred pcs everything is
fine
i basically i virtualize with a layer of another middleware so that people can work and as
as a inducer i dont care that what is going at the other other end so long my program
my processes runs faithfully with a particular performance level which is desired by me so
this is a good chance of using underutilized resources there is a join local communities
so i can have different type of communities like i can say some grid resources for some
biological sciences some arts sciences some genetic research so there are not only computing
but they also give some basic processes to do that right so those things are available
so in other sense i want those resources without having to purchase install maintain at a my
end interaction with underneath layers must be transferred and seamless to the user so
that means i have a interface as a end user i should not be bothered about what is going
on at the other end of the things like how you are using the other leverage resources
etcetera you may ask me for money like if may ask that you need to pay so much ah amount
for so much utilization thats fine but i i may not be ah willing to ah i i i i dont want
to go to the of how you maintain your resources how you maintain your network how what is
the services etcetera that is your thing
so need need of grid computing is well known so especially scientific research community
is a big user of the things specially data analysis data analytics visualization collaboration
between the scientific wall this days across continent people collaborate computer simulation
and modeling are other ah common use scientific and engineering problems are becoming more
complex and need more accurate precise solution for their problem data visualization is becoming
an important aspects of the thing exploiting underutilized resources maybe one of the motivating
forces right i have lot of resources which are underutilize i am want to do that again
this is another stepping stone for towards your ah cloud computing
so who uses grid there are as we say that finally there can physics application weather
application material science reactor application and the so and so forth very few of them are
there but it you can see that all paradigm or ah of research or all paradigm of different
scientific activities are are there where who may be need indeed so there are different
type of grids we will not go to much nativity there is one maybe the computational grid
more on the computing one may the data grid which serves as a more of a data storage
one maybe collaboratively give with that means so that it helps in doing collaborate physics
there are other grids like network grids so providing fault tolerant high performance
communication services over the things there can be utility grid in ah this is a utility
form of grid ah in which not only data and computation cycles are shared but software
or just about any resources are shared of the things so i say this is a utility grid
so there can be different players into the thing definitely grid is a central thing that
is the which provides the thing there there are users who uses grid there are groups which
has a group activity there are different sides or what we resource availability locations
ah of a different heterogeneous sites etcetera not only that there are issues of ah policy
maintaining and other things like which can be share which cannot be shared which can
be computed where a central things are there
then another important aspects computer which which is pretty popular is the cluster computing
ah so what is a cluster a cluster is a type of parallel or distributed computing platform
which consists of collection of interconnected stand alone computing computers working together
in a single integrated computing resources right so it so key components are ah stand
alone computers may be pc workstation or smps operating system hyper performance interconnects
middleware parallel programming environment and applications
so there are different these are there are different these are different ah components
of the cluster computing so clusters are usually deployed to improve speed or reliability over
ah that provided by the single computer right typical clusters are like having the properties
of the ah network faster closer connection ah then a typical lan low latency of communication
protocol and loosely coupled than our smps so there are several type of clusters right
few of them are high availability or failover clusters like it say the resources are so
be highly available if there is a any failure of the cluster node the other things takes
care etcetera there are things are load balancing cluster like if i have particular processes
so the load balancing is done by the cluster there are parallel distributed processing
clusters right these are these helps or these facilitates parallel and distributed ah processing
so these are the clusters which are there so if you look at ah typical cluster nodes
so there is a there is several cluster ah node so and a interconnect of network which
connect the clusters and there are different network characterization of the things like
how it will be connected what what will be the different type of mechanisms so on the
things so there are several operational benefit one
is the system availability is one of the thing ah fault tolerance is one of the thing scalability
another aspects os and application reliability what we expect from the cluster and high performance
usually cluster what we ah what we try to use it as a high it will provide a us high
performance right then there is a with all this paradigm we started with the distributed
computing and different outsource like grid cluster and so and so forth we this has motivated
to a system or to a realization of a things what we say utility computing right
what is utility computing or what is utility utility typically means that if i have something
i need something i should be able to get it as and when i require it right it is as if
you go to the market and purchase the thing or get the services like i want to book a
ah railway or flight ticket so i require some interface it maybe a interface calling a broker
or or a travel agent right so what i do i dont care about how things
happens i want a utility to be there i want a even a plumbing job in my home call up in
my residential complex the utility office and then i say this is the thing right i i
dont care or i even that the person who is taking the call may not be knowing that how
to any plumbing job but he connects or he or she connects to the particular things but
as as a user i want a utility thing there so resources are there as and when we require
trying to that if you look at distributed computing strum that a cluster and other type
of a computing they also some sort of provide try to provide some utility based on the user
need and ah try to i should not say disconnect try to basically ah make the inducer least
bothered about the of maintaining the whole resources right
so utility computing is that it is a purely a concept which cloud computing practically
ah implements what we will see later on its a service provisioning model right model in
which a service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to
the customer as needed and charges them for specific uses rather than the flat rate right
so the word utility is used to make an analogy to a other services like electrical power
right that that seek to meet fluctuating customer needs charge the resources based on the uses
rather than the flat rate basis and approach this approach sometimes called pay per use
or what we say pay as you go model so if we look at our electrical services electrical
things so we have a meter so and we whenever i switch on any electrical appliances it maybe
power it can it can be my electrical light or microwave oven or air conditioning or computing
a computer whatever i resources the as much as my as i consume that much i pay based on
the rates etcetera what is decided by the electrical ah that electric authority or utility
power authority and type of things now i i really dont dont care or dont know
how this powers are generated how these are coming to up to my home only what i care that
i have metered service right whatever i use its a service which is meter another popular
uses is our ah telecom services especially the mobile services right so that also we
use as utility and we take a connection from a again ah telephone or mobile service provider
and then i i want i use i pay as i use right it may be post paid prepaid and type of things
and based on that whatever the ah model of payment model but dont care that whether the
service provider one mobile service provider one whom i am using using another mobile service
provider to connect me to somebody else etcetera etcetera
what i need that facility like calling sending messages and may be data services right data
video services all the things and i am ready to pay the things right so based on that i
select the service so this is also utility services so this typically it is metered and
pay as you go model or pay as you use model type of things so this is a paradigm shift
or how we are looking at the ah computing though it is suddenly definitely it suddenly
one day utility computing or term computing in come knocking at the door so it evolve
from these all distributed systems to computing to cluster to type of other things right
so that is a nice picture nice analogy like assume that there are different it resources
and i if i open up the tap it i can have this applications resources falling from the tap
when i dont require i close it so utility computing as a usually ah so what we we view
as form of virtualization so that the amount of storage or computing power available is
considerably larger than the than a single system sharing computer so what we what we
are thinking it is a enormous amount of resources are there which is which i can use as i it
can be unlimited computing thing which is there it is a unlimited networking unlimited
application which is there like think about if we try to make a analogy
when you ah when we ah using power right unless there is a restriction by the things that
you cannot use more than so much kilowatt or so much megawatt that say one thing otherwise
what virtually we are thinking that there is a enormous resources available at the other
end ah somewhere other and i i i can tap anything which i want to use and i pay for the thing
and i dont want to use i close the thing similarly for the computing also or even if
for telecom or mobile services what we say whenever i am downloading a particular say
file i say that the bandwidth is something which is available whatever i need right it
may be ten kb or hundred kb file or it may be hundred mb file right so but the resources
are there i need to pay for it i need to pay for the whole thing but i am able to use it
so that there is ah another way of looking at it
so in the incase of utility computing what we are trying to see that the computing itself
starting from infrastructure computing resource may be that is hardware or the services like
may be ah a particular platform we where we compile etctera or may be that some particular
data storage capability i can store any type of data or it can be some software like i
want to run particular simulation or mathematical simulation tool when i say that whatever extend
i want to use i can use it i need to pay away so it is as of a huge enormous storage of
things which are there in the thing so it has typical pricing model like our power
grid pay for use pricing model so that is the one of the major thing there is a another
aspects of data center virtualization ah or provisioning right that will come to that
that means i virtualize the resource at my end say i want to emulate a particular system
which has i want say a particular ah processor speed so much ah eight gb sixteen gb or one
twenty eight gb ram so much hand disk and i want to run a particular scientific simulation
for my purpose right so in from the whole volume of resource i
virtualize a resource for my or customize the resource which is assumed as a virtual
instance another user from the same pool of resources may be virtualise for some other
things right so it is a we say that the whole thing has the data center virtualization and
provisioning solves resource utilization problem right i may having lot of resource at my thing
and this allows me to to basically supplied this resources i can do outsource some my
thing like say whenever i am doing this i am outsourcing say software maintenance to
something else or data storage thing something so i am i can do outsourcing
web service level delivery right so that we will see that is ah what we these days what
we are or rather last couple means rather last one decade mode primarily we have ah
shifted from a data driven architecture to a service driven architecture so what we look
at more as a services than the data correct so that is it utilization and then i have
a enormous scope of automation right if i have different resources etcetera then the
whole i can have a i can build a work flow which allows me to automate the whole resources
so there is another aspects of this utility computing
so one example may be on demand cyber infrastructure like i want to do a particular ah say examination
for for my for recruiting ah some ah recruiting or test of my students ah and i want to have
a separate infrastructure and they are they may be are in different physical location
may be in different departments or if they from their house i want a cyber infrastructure
which allows me to have a a virtual resources which they can take their exam correct
so this i can have this type of cyber infrastructure i can have a typical cyber infrastructure
in case of a say ah some event management ah typical event management like i want to
manage a conference and for that period i want to have service cyber infrastructure
i can have a infrastructure for disasters management which is more of a real time that
resource need maybe may vary from one to another but i i dont want to keep those resources
like i i ah say here at organized conference say it may be coming in a one or two in a
month or type of things workshop etcetera and i do not want to keep a separate infrastructure
for the things i want to make a infrastructure as i when i require i may pay for the things
so that is one on demand cyber infrastructure may be the one thing
there is another aspects of things whenever so what we see there is a provider or service
provider there is a consumer those those two category of things has different requirement
and we have different models or different what we say ah management issues which ties
them together like one maybe pricing what price you give right so that say i want to
if you take analogy i want to take a service provider which gives me a favorable price
for my services like i i want ah more of a data service than calling i want data services
more so i want to invest on those ah i want to select those service provider mobile service
provider who gives me a better rate or better performance i dont care about the rate performance
on this data services somebody may be more interested in the calling or messaging so
they will do on their own so that is that is the pricing model there
there should be a service level agreement like if i if i do this type of things what
should be the service level agreement what should be the availability down time etcetera
there can be a security aspects right if i ah say i want to use and store data etcetera
so somebody else would not be using or looking at my data ah so there would a security aspects
even security aspects like denial of services type of things should not be there that also
i can look at the security aspects there can be a access mechanisms etcetera
and there may be a need for application sizing the application need to be sized for me some
application may be for doing data churning for terabytes of data but i do want to analyze
with some megabytes of data so i dont want that large application neither i want to purchase
the thing but i want to size the application based on my need right or in like reverse
in the other way so there can be different type of payment models right so it can be
flat rate tiered and type of things different pricing model for different customer based
on factors like scale commitment payment frequency etcetera i can have customized things
principle of utility computing ah remains same the pricing model is simply an expression
of the providers of the cost let me say its a how how much provisioning of resources etcetera
will come into the there are several risk we say or disadvantages based on this utility
computing one one may be the data backup my data is somewhere if there is a crash what
will happen right you store the data in third party and if there is a crash or whether that
service provider itself goes ah out of the business then what will happen
there is a data security aspects somebody else is reading or my data or not there is
a competence issue that what i am working with whether that organization is competent
enough defining is is another big problem because everybody want to define that agreements
on their favour and there is still not very standard approach of doing that across the
different provider and consumer getting value from charge back that is also things which
we look at that how i get values of my charge backs and these all will evolved as a cloud
computing all right so cloud computing is a model for enabling
ubiquitous convenient on demand network access to a sheared pool of resources or configurable
resources such as network server storage application services that can be rapidly provision and
released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction so it says everything
right so this is the typical nist definition ah which we all everybody try to ah what we
say follow or respect so it says that any the huge pool of resources can be provisioned
with minimal management referred and provision and deprovision when i use it and when i have
to release it both can be ah done in a very seamless manner
so this is this if you look at what we have discussed or from your ah background computing
knowledge this is something which is not came up suddenly on on the table what it there
it evolved from some of the things like rather we look we want to look the computing world
in a different way and try to facilitate computing to different type of purposes with some basic
modeling basic model like the pricing model sla model say there is a security model management
things that means we want to place different things and so that a computing as service
can be provided like i want to provide computing as a service
so what we will do with this we will end our todays talk and we will continue with this
thing with the different other aspects of the things so this we will do another aspect
i want to mention that some of these ah materials some of these figures etcetera are ah taken
from different resources we have i have tried to put all the references and acknowledge
those things we want to do it specifically for academic ah purpose only for that for
our landing mechanisms ah no no no where it anything commercially using all
so what we do we with this we end our todays talk and in the coming lectures we will look
at other other aspects or different aspects not other aspects different aspects of cloud
computing ah how it goes and what are the different what are the different properties
advantages disadvantages and like that thank you

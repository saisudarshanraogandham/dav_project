ah welcome to the course on cloud computing today ah we will have our first ah lecture
so as as you might have seen the broad overview of the course so in this particular series
of lectures we will try to ah give an ah a overall picture of what cloud computing is
and ah what are its major components and ah what are the recent trends and at the end
may be what are the different type of a research opportunities or this trends of ah future
trends in the cloud computing right so so before going to the details of cloud computing
we will try to have a quick overview of course and the basic paradigm of computing
now if you look that as defined by acm computing curricula in two thousand five as they defined
computing it say ah general way we can ah define computing to mean ah as a mean to solve
any goal oriented activity right so that means it it can be it can include starting from
hardware software system for a wide range of purposes and also ah making computing systems
intelligent using communications finding gathering informations from relevant to any particular
purpose and so on so if you look at it has anything where some sort of a computing is
needed it falls under the computing paradigm so this this gives us a broad spectrum of
thing not only in terms of resources also in terms of the terms are category a level
of people who can who are going to using you staring from a high end researcher or a professional
to a student to even to a housewife or a citizen in general look one to use it for its benefit
or something which particular purpose ok before ah going to other overview of this computing
i will i will lets try to reiterate the type of a codes or type of things we will like
to cover so initial lectures we will have a more ah
things most likely today and may be ah something on the next day that introduction to cloud
computing which has gives overview what that nist models says what are the typical properties
characteristics advantage and disadvantages of cloud computing or role of open standards
so whether there is a standardization need or things then we will look at more on a cloud
computing architecture like what is the typical computing cloud computing stack moving towards
a service oriented architecture so what sort of service models are available in cloud like
typically infrastructure as a service platform as a service or software as a service or anything
as a service let are we will see that anything as a service whether we can realize what are
the different deployment models right in in case of a cloud how when i want to deploy
whether it is in a what all be the different deployment models of a cloud then one of the
another major aspect of cloud is the service management ah like like as as we ah whenever
we try to ah purchase any service or whenever i want to leverage any service there is a
need of service management like like from the say consumer end i i would like to have
what is the guarantee of minimal services ah from the upto wider end the ah cloud provider
or cloud service provider csp one to see that may be the profit or may be ah may be that
how this guarantee what are the resource requirement at the back end to surf so much computers
so from the if you look at the provider consumer for any type of services not only cloud services
any type of services in our day today life we require some sort of a agreement between
the service provider and the consumer what in what we say something call service level
agreement like i want to say that my availability will be hundred percent or near hundred percent
based on my thing like i say when a exam is going on i want to have redundant services
so that the availability of the resources is hundred percent or very near to hundred
percent whereas when i my practice session is going on requirement of availability may
come down to ninety percent now based on the availability the resource tooling or resource
management will be done by the at the ah provider end and the provider will charge based on
the type of type of its resources type of availability etcetera then there are issues
of down time what will be there are issues of quality of services there are several other
issues that we will try to discuss under the paradigm of ah service level agreements and
other things there is another important person another important aspects is cloudonomics
or economy of using cloud computing it may not be whether it is always good that if i
use cloud it will be beneficial whether it is true like it is as as we see like suppose
if you want to commute two twenty kilometer per day for your office or work then it may
be economical to purchase a car right but if you are commuting say even fifty kilometer
or hundred kilometer once in a month it may not be economical ah then purchasing a car
right it may be more economical than hiring a car right similarly when i suit hire when
i suit purchase whether there is a relationship whether there is a economic model behind it
or what if at all how to how how do i from my ah say organization point of view may be
from a particular say even point of view whether i can see that whether purchasing or hiring
a resources or is economical or what is the what is the economic model of the things
so that type of things economics in cloud or economy in cloud we have to see another
aspect is the resource management like this is more in the service provider end right
or cloud service provider how these resources will be manage right like i ah so what i what
i see that i have i need to surf so many people so what sort of resources i need to manage
at the things this is true for anything like if i say if i have a stationary or who which
takes care of stationary is related to say academic things like i says a note books pen
and etcetera etcetera so how much i need to stock or it depend on how much ah maybe myself
projection etcetera or ah so i donot have some a situation when i am starving for my
store or i should not have a situation when i am say my full and i need to keep some thing
outside the soft type of things right so it is i should not have a loading so i have a
proper resource management so it is very tricky when we have a computing as a resource ah
or when i provide computing as a resource then i have to manage several type of resources
like typically of i look at a in a typical computing system forget about cloud or anything
so what are the things we are basically looking for maybe one maybe the processor or the cpu
popularly or maybe ah or one maybe the your ah working memory or popularly the ram or
hard disk and maybe network connectivity and there are other several other resources which
are they are right so how much resources i need to maintain manage
etcetera right so any resources has a ah inherent hosting into the things so if i need to manage
huge volume of resources without utilization then i have to incur what we say more cost
on the resources or ah than in maintaining the things so this appropriate or optimally
management of resources is a serious challenge and they are here like to see that what are
the different type of resource management issues in these ah particular ah cloud computing
thing so other aspects of these cloud computing one is the data management right so data is
the very tricky thing like we look to look at this how these data will be stored manage
scalability and cloud services over this data services over that if it is a not only data
of it is a data bases and data stores so there there is a separate type of looking at the
data things in the cloud and if it is a large scale data processing then i need to look
at the ah how this data management will be there so our conventional way of approaching
normal data or data base management system whether it is still still good for cloud or
whenever i want to give as data storage or type of services so what type of things i
need to do for the things like like we are popularly using different type of storage
as a service ah stuffs and ah in our day today life like one of the popular thing may be
the drop box so how things at the background need to be manage so it s not like that i
need to build it at a services all the but at least looking at that what are this architecture
and what are the issues in data management type of things
another major aspects of a cloud is security right so your data is in some other place
you are computing in in some other others domain so what will be the different type
of security aspects so at it has ah like what will be the security which has been a infrastructure
as thing or what are data related or storage related security because data is a important
aspects of our all things like what ah what many people say that ah you can ah regenerate
a or reinstall an application but you cannot reinstall your data right i really write a
report of hundred or ten pages and it gets system get crashed and then data is lost along
with the application i can reinstall the ways i can reinstall the ah what processing tool
but i reinstalling the data is not possible that particular report is not possible of
not you have a recovery mechanism expect them right whenever i have on my personal system
like it may be personal computing desktop or in a laptop or wherever then it is my responsibility
to take backups or i have redundancy things inter things but whenever i store the data
into the others place then one is one is how things are saved and type of things ah in
case of loss or another typical thing comes up whether my data is being accessed or over
retained ride somebody else right so that means whether this what is the security of
this particular data there are issues of identity and access management so this is this is another
important aspects where particular identity and access management of the collaborating
collaborating parties need to be there there are issues of access control trust reputation
risk so there are several issues like how how access control will be there whether it
is a our standard access control mechanism so whether role base access control mechanism
or whatever things we can we work on on the security how much trust on i have being i
have a cloud service provider whether i trust service provider one more than the service
provider two or ah whether it is how to calculate a particular ah service provider so there
are issues of the reputation i want to look at a reputation there are issues of risk of
losing data losing application losing your because ah your own customers like you are
purchasing cloud to surf somebody right so you you may intern things so this trust
reputation risk goes somewhere what we say three nodes of a triangle so they are interlinked
have a in for any ah systems they have a ah lot of what we say a lot of influence on working
of the whole systems right so i need to assure that ah how it is assured in the on cloud
computing paradigm that you see then we will try to look at some of case studies ah or
or some some ah what we say demo type of things on open source comma and on commercial cloud
may be some cloud simulator there are various commercial cloud in things ah in the ah in
the market so we will try to see that what are the ah basic property or how they work
etcetera then there are open source cloud so we are yet to see that how we open source
things are there when we will if if time permits we will try to see that what are the different
type of installing a open source cloud and there are ah few cloud simulators also so
we like to if it is time permits we like to see the simulator and at the end of the things
as as one of our major ah motivation of this academic world to take things in a in future
right we want to see that something more in the future so we will try to look at the recent
trend in cloud computing so those who are interested in research or
even some of projects in pg level ug level so they can they can have a pointer that what
are the different aspects of sentence in cloud computing there are there are people are talking
about fog computing and other different technologies so we like to see that what are the different
aspects of those things so this is broadly the overall code structure we will try to
give a proper weightage based on the importance of the ah course we will and we will give
more details as an when we will we will basically going through those lectures right so with
this we will try we will we will have a quick overview of what are the different computing
trend which which actually made this cloud computing a reality so it is it is ah not
that it is from the day one something was there so it as we say that all all invention
or all any type of development is primarily come up with ah some necessity or requirement
of the of the what we say community scientific community or even ah general citizen at large
so that drives that to what there one of the things there are definitely sky searches where
we we it is driven by that in own things but we will like to see that so much computing
is already was in place or is in place while still it has the importance whether it is
a totally new baby or new stuff or it is a amalgamation or evolve through the things
right so what we see it is in different literatures or even in if you look at the cloud computing
as a all it is not a a suddenly new stuff which came into the play it has a evolved
and it has different other development which is already in place which has ah basically
helped in ah bringing this into ah play so ah if we look at that different type of computing
paradigm which are ah or which where they are for long time and still ah still in a
it is there in a big way so one first a of all the mother of the things
all those things is known as the distributed or people say that it is a distributed computing
right so distributed computing then we have differ and other computing it is not that
ah it came ah in the sequence like one after another but it is more of the these are the
different aspects what we look at the things so it is a distributed computing we have grid
computing we have cluster computing we have utility computing and we are talking about
cloud computing now if we ah see that ah these different development where different needs
everybody has advantages some bodies advantages and they helped in making some other things
in a feasible way so we will go quickly because these are some of the things already known
to you and are available in the literature just to have that why what is the how it came
up this cloud computing may be things so if you look at distributed computing so ah so
we started with or still we are we work with centralized computing like primarily in previous
days we used to use mainframe where different terminals are there so jobs are submitted
to the mainframe that get executed and being used by the ah or being viewed by the user
so primarily it is a something which is has a ah logically single processing thing right
so or what we say some sort of a uni processor ah computing or centralized computing type
of things now also in different places is there it is not like that we need to throw
out the things there is a particular necessity of the things and if these are still useful
in several places and being used at several areas so the other thing which evolved is
the distributed computing we where you have different systems ah distributed ah over a
ah particular geographical space ah typically it may vary from a lab type of a scenario
to a scenario where you have large geographical boundaries also again on depends on the ah
type of requirements are there right and one important aspects came up is that network
link availability of seemless network connectivity during between this collaborating systems
like they or what we say different ah different network systems right so so it is basically
a field of computing science that studies distributed systems it was there for long
time use of distributed system to solve computational processes all right there are different other
type of other definitions which come up if you look at the internet several definitions
come so there are several it is one says that there
are several autonomous computational entities each of has its own local memory so it is
separate autonomous independent computing entities having their own local memories the
entities communicate with each other by message passing over a backbone communication network
right so that is one thing if we look at the operating system point of or where the concept
the processor communicates with each other through various communicational line say at
high speed busses or even telephone lines where the things each processor has its own
local memory right so there are several type of example people put different things in
the distributed computing pairing ah starting from over internetworking is a distributed
system ah or this atms bank machines different branches of the banks or even different collaborating
and doing ah executing different functions that can be a things intranet or workgroups
within the intranets may be a distributed system computing landscape will soon consist
of ubiquitous network connected devices right ah or rather not will be it is already we
have ubiquitous ah network connected devices so or what we say it is something haddock
type of establishment which comes and type of things and these days we see different
type of ah networks which are which form as a ad hoc network they are different volatile
like one example is vehicular ad hoc networks right like vehicles ah smart vehicles with
their own ah on communication path once they come together they form a ad hoc network and
it it it executes different type of function like maybe safety related things may be entertainment
related or infotainment related type of things and different type of stuff are there
so of we look at the broad type of computers in a distributed systems so they are ah primarily
what we say workstation ah server systems and personal ah assistance devices like it
may so workstation is computers which are in the inducer to perform computing server
systems which works on a ah which give some provide some services per say so computers
which provide resources and services right there can be personal assistance devices like
handheld computers connected to systems where wireless communication network i can be any
type of things like any type of communication paradigms which helps in communicating with
a things so these are the different ah what we say typical end nodes in a distributed
systems right there can be other type of ah nodes also like i ah which has more network
capabilities network processing type of things etcetera but this what we can say broadly
these are the typical loads in a ah in a typical distributed system
so if we look at the why such of thing some common properties or common advantages or
what we say ah benefits of distributed system one is fault tolerant like you have ah one
or more ah means several systems are working so even with some node failures it works faithfully
right or may be at a lower ah lower performance but it is ah it is not totally out of ah service
right had it been a centralized system so if down the whole thing is down what do you
get to do something in a lower thing so ah it also to make it fault tolerant there are
different mechanisms that said the was many of you may be knowing and to make the things
so there are other thing that each know another ah typical aspect is each node play its partial
role right so each node in the distributed system plays its partial role there is another
aspects of or a property of resource sharing the share resources among themselves there
is a load sharing so what is not only resource sharing that computing resource sharing but
also load sharing like if i if it is a load or what we say that load balancing among the
things can be realized easy to expand so use any systems may be like that that we can easy
to expand like like i can have ah i can had ah distributed system ah more system into
the network as and when as and when i have it or use it performance is a issue so parallel
computing can be considered as a subset of a distributed systems where i can have higher
performance and need to be monitor so what we will ah ah so another aspect of
distributed system is that why why we require maybe the the nature of application demands
it maybe the ah different performance like i have computing intensive data intensive
type of a things and in some of the cases i require a robustness into the system that
should be no single point failure i I dint want any single point failure i may be doing
a miss and critical things which may not be very computing intensive or memory intensive
but i I cant afford to do any failure on the system right so in the several cases there
is a need of the things or in other sense this this need primarily one of the primary
ah what we say motivation of developing or development of this distributed systems so
we will we will ah break for now and we will continue our discussion in the subsequent
in the next lecture thank you"
ah welcome to the course on cloud computing today ah we will have our first ah lecture
so as as you might have seen the broad overview of the course so in this particular series
of lectures we will try to ah give an ah a overall picture of what cloud computing is
in the next lecture thank you"
may be what are the different type of a research opportunities or this trends of ah future
trends in the cloud computing right so so before going to the details of cloud computing
we will try to have a quick overview of course and the basic paradigm of computing
now if you look that as defined by acm computing curricula in two thousand five as they defined

intelligent using communications finding gathering informations from relevant to any particular
purpose and so on so if you look at it has anything where some sort of a computing is
needed it falls under the computing paradigm so this this gives us a broad spectrum of
thing not only in terms of resources also in terms of the terms are category a level
of people who can who are going to using you staring from a high end researcher or a professional
to a student to even to a housewife or a citizen in general look one to use it for its benefit
or something which particular purpose ok before ah going to other overview of this computing
i will i will lets try to reiterate the type of a codes or type of things we will like
to cover so initial lectures we will have a more ah
things most likely today and may be ah something on the next day that introduction to cloud
computing which has gives overview what that nist models says what are the typical properties
characteristics advantage and disadvantages of cloud computing or role of open standards
so whether there is a standardization need or things then we will look at more on a cloud
computing architecture like what is the typical computing cloud computing stack moving towards
a service oriented architecture so what sort of service models are available in cloud like
typically infrastructure as a service platform as a service or software as a service or anything
as a service let are we will see that anything as a service whether we can realize what are
the different deployment models right in in case of a cloud how when i want to deploy
whether it is in a what all be the different deployment models of a cloud then one of the
another major aspect of cloud is the service management ah like like as as we ah whenever
we try to ah purchase any service or whenever i want to leverage any service there is a
need of service management like like from the say consumer end i i would like to have
what is the guarantee of minimal services ah from the upto wider end the ah cloud provider
or cloud service provider csp one to see that may be the profit or may be ah may be that
how this guarantee what are the resource requirement at the back end to surf so much computers
so from the if you look at the provider consumer for any type of services not only cloud services
any type of services in our day today life we require some sort of a agreement between
the service provider and the consumer what in what we say something call service level
agreement like i want to say that my availability will be hundred percent or near hundred percent
based on my thing like i say when a exam is going on i want to have redundant services
so that the availability of the resources is hundred percent or very near to hundred

come down to ninety percent now based on the availability the resource tooling or resource
management will be done by the at the ah provider end and the provider will charge based on
the type of type of its resources type of availability etcetera then there are issues
of down time what will be there are issues of quality of services there are several other
issues that we will try to discuss under the paradigm of ah service level agreements and
other things there is another important person another important aspects is cloudonomics
or economy of using cloud computing it may not be whether it is always good that if i
use cloud it will be beneficial whether it is true like it is as as we see like suppose
if you want to commute two twenty kilometer per day for your office or work then it may
be economical to purchase a car right but if you are commuting say even fifty kilometer
or hundred kilometer once in a month it may not be economical ah then purchasing a car
right it may be more economical than hiring a car right similarly when i suit hire when
i suit purchase whether there is a relationship whether there is a economic model behind it
or what if at all how to how how do i from my ah say organization point of view may be
from a particular say even point of view whether i can see that whether purchasing or hiring
a resources or is economical or what is the what is the economic model of the things
so that type of things economics in cloud or economy in cloud we have to see another
aspect is the resource management like this is more in the service provider end right
or cloud service provider how these resources will be manage right like i ah so what i what
i see that i have i need to surf so many people so what sort of resources i need to manage
at the things this is true for anything like if i say if i have a stationary or who which
takes care of stationary is related to say academic things like i says a note books pen
and etcetera etcetera so how much i need to stock or it depend on how much ah maybe myself
projection etcetera or ah so i donot have some a situation when i am starving for my

another major aspects of a cloud is security right so your data is in some other place

of security aspects so at it has ah like what will be the security which has been a infrastructure

important aspects where particular identity and access management of the collaborating

are issues of the reputation i want to look at a reputation there are issues of risk of
losing data losing application losing your because ah your own customers like you are
purchasing cloud to surf somebody right so you you may intern things so this trust
reputation risk goes somewhere what we say three nodes of a triangle so they are interlinked

in several places and being used at several areas so the other thing which evolved is
the distributed computing we where you have different systems ah distributed ah over a
ah particular geographical space ah typically it may vary from a lab type of a scenario
to a scenario where you have large geographical boundaries also again on depends on the ah
type of requirements are there right and one important aspects came up is that network
link availability of seemless network connectivity during between this collaborating systems
like they or what we say different ah different network systems right so so it is basically
a field of computing science that studies distributed systems it was there for long
time use of distributed system to solve computational processes all right there are different other
type of other definitions which come up if you look at the internet several definitions
come so there are several it is one says that there
are several autonomous computational entities each of has its own local memory so it is
separate autonomous independent computing entities having their own local memories the
entities communicate with each other by message passing over a backbone communication network
right so that is one thing if we look at the operating system point of or where the concept
the processor communicates with each other through various communicational line say at
high speed busses or even telephone lines where the things each processor has its own
local memory right so there are several type of example people put different things in
the distributed computing pairing ah starting from over internetworking is a distributed
system ah or this atms bank machines different branches of the banks or even different collaborating
and doing ah executing different functions that can be a things intranet or workgroups
within the intranets may be a distributed system computing landscape will soon consist
of ubiquitous network connected devices right ah or rather not will be it is already we
have ubiquitous ah network connected devices so or what we say it is something haddock
type of establishment which comes and type of things and these days we see different
type of ah networks which are which form as a ad hoc network they are different volatile
like one example is vehicular ad hoc networks right like vehicles ah smart vehicles with
their own ah on communication path once they come together they form a ad hoc network and
it it it executes different type of function like maybe safety related things may be entertainment
related or infotainment related type of things and different type of stuff are there
so of we look at the broad type of computers in a distributed systems so they are ah primarily
what we say workstation ah server systems and personal ah assistance devices like it
may so workstation is computers which are in the inducer to perform computing server
systems which works on a ah which give some provide some services per say so computers
which provide resources and services right there can be personal assistance devices like
handheld computers connected to systems where wireless communication network i can be any
type of things like any type of communication paradigms which helps in communicating with
a things so these are the different ah what we say typical end nodes in a distributed
systems right there can be other type of ah nodes also like i ah which has more network
capabilities network processing type of things etcetera but this what we can say broadly
these are the typical loads in a ah in a typical distributed system
so if we look at the why such of thing some common properties or common advantages or
what we say ah benefits of distributed system one is fault tolerant like you have ah one
or more ah means several systems are working so even with some node failures it works faithfully
right or may be at a lower ah lower performance but it is ah it is not totally out of ah service
right had it been a centralized system so if down the whole thing is down what do you
get to do something in a lower thing so ah it also to make it fault tolerant there are
different mechanisms that said the was many of you may be knowing and to make the things
so there are other thing that each know another ah typical aspect is each node play its partial
role right so each node in the distributed system plays its partial role there is another
aspects of or a property of resource sharing the share resources among themselves there
is a load sharing so what is not only resource sharing that computing resource sharing but
also load sharing like if i if it is a load or what we say that load balancing among the
things can be realized easy to expand so use any systems may be like that that we can easy
to expand like like i can have ah i can had ah distributed system ah more system into
the network as and when as and when i have it or use it performance is a issue so parallel
computing can be considered as a subset of a distributed systems where i can have higher
performance and need to be monitor so what we will ah ah so another aspect of
distributed system is that why why we require maybe the the nature of application demands
it maybe the ah different performance like i have computing intensive data intensive
type of a things and in some of the cases i require a robustness into the system that
should be no single point failure i I dint want any single point failure i may be doing
a miss and critical things which may not be very computing intensive or memory intensive
but i I cant afford to do any failure on the system right so in the several cases there
is a need of the things or in other sense this this need primarily one of the primary
ah what we say motivation of developing or development of this distributed systems so
we will we will ah break for now and we will continue our discussion in the subsequent
in the next lecture thank you"
ah welcome to the course on cloud computing today ah we will have our first ah lecture"
so as as you might have seen the broad overview of the course so in this particular series"
of lectures we will try to ah give an ah a overall picture of what cloud computing is"
and ah what are its major components and ah what are the recent trends and at the end"
may be what are the different type of a research opportunities or this trends of ah future"
trends in the cloud computing right so so before going to the details of cloud computing"
we will try to have a quick overview of course and the basic paradigm of computing"
now if you look that as defined by acm computing curricula in two thousand five as they defined"
computing it say ah general way we can ah define computing to mean ah as a mean to solve"
any goal oriented activity right so that means it it can be it can include starting from"
hardware software system for a wide range of purposes and also ah making computing systems"
intelligent using communications finding gathering informations from relevant to any particular"
purpose and so on so if you look at it has anything where some sort of a computing is"
needed it falls under the computing paradigm so this this gives us a broad spectrum of"
thing not only in terms of resources also in terms of the terms are category a level"
of people who can who are going to using you staring from a high end researcher or a professional"
to a student to even to a housewife or a citizen in general look one to use it for its benefit"
or something which particular purpose ok before ah going to other overview of this computing"
i will i will lets try to reiterate the type of a codes or type of things we will like"
to cover so initial lectures we will have a more ah"
things most likely today and may be ah something on the next day that introduction to cloud"
computing which has gives overview what that nist models says what are the typical properties"
characteristics advantage and disadvantages of cloud computing or role of open standards"
so whether there is a standardization need or things then we will look at more on a cloud"
computing architecture like what is the typical computing cloud computing stack moving towards"
a service oriented architecture so what sort of service models are available in cloud like"
typically infrastructure as a service platform as a service or software as a service or anything"
as a service let are we will see that anything as a service whether we can realize what are"
the different deployment models right in in case of a cloud how when i want to deploy"
whether it is in a what all be the different deployment models of a cloud then one of the"
another major aspect of cloud is the service management ah like like as as we ah whenever"
we try to ah purchase any service or whenever i want to leverage any service there is a"
need of service management like like from the say consumer end i i would like to have"
what is the guarantee of minimal services ah from the upto wider end the ah cloud provider"
or cloud service provider csp one to see that may be the profit or may be ah may be that"
how this guarantee what are the resource requirement at the back end to surf so much computers"
so from the if you look at the provider consumer for any type of services not only cloud services"
any type of services in our day today life we require some sort of a agreement between"
the service provider and the consumer what in what we say something call service level"
agreement like i want to say that my availability will be hundred percent or near hundred percent"
based on my thing like i say when a exam is going on i want to have redundant services"
so that the availability of the resources is hundred percent or very near to hundred"
percent whereas when i my practice session is going on requirement of availability may"
come down to ninety percent now based on the availability the resource tooling or resource"
management will be done by the at the ah provider end and the provider will charge based on"
the type of type of its resources type of availability etcetera then there are issues"
of down time what will be there are issues of quality of services there are several other"
issues that we will try to discuss under the paradigm of ah service level agreements and"
other things there is another important person another important aspects is cloudonomics"
or economy of using cloud computing it may not be whether it is always good that if i"
use cloud it will be beneficial whether it is true like it is as as we see like suppose"
if you want to commute two twenty kilometer per day for your office or work then it may"
be economical to purchase a car right but if you are commuting say even fifty kilometer"
or hundred kilometer once in a month it may not be economical ah then purchasing a car"
right it may be more economical than hiring a car right similarly when i suit hire when"
i suit purchase whether there is a relationship whether there is a economic model behind it"
or what if at all how to how how do i from my ah say organization point of view may be"
from a particular say even point of view whether i can see that whether purchasing or hiring"
a resources or is economical or what is the what is the economic model of the things"
so that type of things economics in cloud or economy in cloud we have to see another"
aspect is the resource management like this is more in the service provider end right"
or cloud service provider how these resources will be manage right like i ah so what i what"
i see that i have i need to surf so many people so what sort of resources i need to manage"
at the things this is true for anything like if i say if i have a stationary or who which"
takes care of stationary is related to say academic things like i says a note books pen"
and etcetera etcetera so how much i need to stock or it depend on how much ah maybe myself"
projection etcetera or ah so i donot have some a situation when i am starving for my"
store or i should not have a situation when i am say my full and i need to keep some thing"
outside the soft type of things right so it is i should not have a loading so i have a"
proper resource management so it is very tricky when we have a computing as a resource ah"
or when i provide computing as a resource then i have to manage several type of resources"
like typically of i look at a in a typical computing system forget about cloud or anything"
so what are the things we are basically looking for maybe one maybe the processor or the cpu"
popularly or maybe ah or one maybe the your ah working memory or popularly the ram or"
hard disk and maybe network connectivity and there are other several other resources which"
are they are right so how much resources i need to maintain manage"
etcetera right so any resources has a ah inherent hosting into the things so if i need to manage"
huge volume of resources without utilization then i have to incur what we say more cost"
on the resources or ah than in maintaining the things so this appropriate or optimally"
management of resources is a serious challenge and they are here like to see that what are"
the different type of resource management issues in these ah particular ah cloud computing"
thing so other aspects of these cloud computing one is the data management right so data is"
the very tricky thing like we look to look at this how these data will be stored manage"
scalability and cloud services over this data services over that if it is a not only data"
of it is a data bases and data stores so there there is a separate type of looking at the"
data things in the cloud and if it is a large scale data processing then i need to look"
at the ah how this data management will be there so our conventional way of approaching"
normal data or data base management system whether it is still still good for cloud or"
whenever i want to give as data storage or type of services so what type of things i"
need to do for the things like like we are popularly using different type of storage"
as a service ah stuffs and ah in our day today life like one of the popular thing may be"
the drop box so how things at the background need to be manage so it s not like that i"
need to build it at a services all the but at least looking at that what are this architecture"
and what are the issues in data management type of things"
another major aspects of a cloud is security right so your data is in some other place"
you are computing in in some other others domain so what will be the different type"
of security aspects so at it has ah like what will be the security which has been a infrastructure"
as thing or what are data related or storage related security because data is a important"
aspects of our all things like what ah what many people say that ah you can ah regenerate"
a or reinstall an application but you cannot reinstall your data right i really write a"
report of hundred or ten pages and it gets system get crashed and then data is lost along"
with the application i can reinstall the ways i can reinstall the ah what processing tool"
but i reinstalling the data is not possible that particular report is not possible of"
not you have a recovery mechanism expect them right whenever i have on my personal system"
like it may be personal computing desktop or in a laptop or wherever then it is my responsibility"
to take backups or i have redundancy things inter things but whenever i store the data"
into the others place then one is one is how things are saved and type of things ah in"
case of loss or another typical thing comes up whether my data is being accessed or over"
retained ride somebody else right so that means whether this what is the security of"
this particular data there are issues of identity and access management so this is this is another"
important aspects where particular identity and access management of the collaborating"
collaborating parties need to be there there are issues of access control trust reputation"
risk so there are several issues like how how access control will be there whether it"
is a our standard access control mechanism so whether role base access control mechanism"
or whatever things we can we work on on the security how much trust on i have being i"
have a cloud service provider whether i trust service provider one more than the service"
provider two or ah whether it is how to calculate a particular ah service provider so there"
are issues of the reputation i want to look at a reputation there are issues of risk of"
losing data losing application losing your because ah your own customers like you are"
purchasing cloud to surf somebody right so you you may intern things so this trust"
reputation risk goes somewhere what we say three nodes of a triangle so they are interlinked"
have a in for any ah systems they have a ah lot of what we say a lot of influence on working"
of the whole systems right so i need to assure that ah how it is assured in the on cloud"
computing paradigm that you see then we will try to look at some of case studies ah or"
or some some ah what we say demo type of things on open source comma and on commercial cloud"
may be some cloud simulator there are various commercial cloud in things ah in the ah in"
the market so we will try to see that what are the ah basic property or how they work"
etcetera then there are open source cloud so we are yet to see that how we open source"
things are there when we will if if time permits we will try to see that what are the different"
type of installing a open source cloud and there are ah few cloud simulators also so"
we like to if it is time permits we like to see the simulator and at the end of the things"
as as one of our major ah motivation of this academic world to take things in a in future"
right we want to see that something more in the future so we will try to look at the recent"
trend in cloud computing so those who are interested in research or"
even some of projects in pg level ug level so they can they can have a pointer that what"
are the different aspects of sentence in cloud computing there are there are people are talking"
about fog computing and other different technologies so we like to see that what are the different"
aspects of those things so this is broadly the overall code structure we will try to"
give a proper weightage based on the importance of the ah course we will and we will give"
more details as an when we will we will basically going through those lectures right so with"
this we will try we will we will have a quick overview of what are the different computing"
trend which which actually made this cloud computing a reality so it is it is ah not"
that it is from the day one something was there so it as we say that all all invention"
or all any type of development is primarily come up with ah some necessity or requirement"
of the of the what we say community scientific community or even ah general citizen at large"
so that drives that to what there one of the things there are definitely sky searches where"
we we it is driven by that in own things but we will like to see that so much computing"
is already was in place or is in place while still it has the importance whether it is"
a totally new baby or new stuff or it is a amalgamation or evolve through the things"
right so what we see it is in different literatures or even in if you look at the cloud computing"
as a all it is not a a suddenly new stuff which came into the play it has a evolved"
and it has different other development which is already in place which has ah basically"
helped in ah bringing this into ah play so ah if we look at that different type of computing"
paradigm which are ah or which where they are for long time and still ah still in a"
it is there in a big way so one first a of all the mother of the things"
all those things is known as the distributed or people say that it is a distributed computing"
right so distributed computing then we have differ and other computing it is not that"
ah it came ah in the sequence like one after another but it is more of the these are the"
different aspects what we look at the things so it is a distributed computing we have grid"
computing we have cluster computing we have utility computing and we are talking about"
cloud computing now if we ah see that ah these different development where different needs"
everybody has advantages some bodies advantages and they helped in making some other things"
in a feasible way so we will go quickly because these are some of the things already known"
to you and are available in the literature just to have that why what is the how it came"
up this cloud computing may be things so if you look at distributed computing so ah so"
we started with or still we are we work with centralized computing like primarily in previous"
days we used to use mainframe where different terminals are there so jobs are submitted"
to the mainframe that get executed and being used by the ah or being viewed by the user"
so primarily it is a something which is has a ah logically single processing thing right"
so or what we say some sort of a uni processor ah computing or centralized computing type"
of things now also in different places is there it is not like that we need to throw"
out the things there is a particular necessity of the things and if these are still useful"
in several places and being used at several areas so the other thing which evolved is"
the distributed computing we where you have different systems ah distributed ah over a"
ah particular geographical space ah typically it may vary from a lab type of a scenario"
to a scenario where you have large geographical boundaries also again on depends on the ah"
type of requirements are there right and one important aspects came up is that network"
link availability of seemless network connectivity during between this collaborating systems"
like they or what we say different ah different network systems right so so it is basically"
a field of computing science that studies distributed systems it was there for long"
time use of distributed system to solve computational processes all right there are different other"
type of other definitions which come up if you look at the internet several definitions"
come so there are several it is one says that there"

the processor communicates with each other through various communicational line say at"
high speed busses or even telephone lines where the things each processor has its own"
local memory right so there are several type of example people put different things in"
the distributed computing pairing ah starting from over internetworking is a distributed"
system ah or this atms bank machines different branches of the banks or even different collaborating"
and doing ah executing different functions that can be a things intranet or workgroups"
within the intranets may be a distributed system computing landscape will soon consist"
of ubiquitous network connected devices right ah or rather not will be it is already we"
have ubiquitous ah network connected devices so or what we say it is something haddock"
type of establishment which comes and type of things and these days we see different"
type of ah networks which are which form as a ad hoc network they are different volatile"

their own ah on communication path once they come together they form a ad hoc network and"
it it it executes different type of function like maybe safety related things may be entertainment"
related or infotainment related type of things and different type of stuff are there"
so of we look at the broad type of computers in a distributed systems so they are ah primarily"
what we say workstation ah server systems and personal ah assistance devices like it"
may so workstation is computers which are in the inducer to perform computing server"
systems which works on a ah which give some provide some services per say so computers"

is a need of the things or in other sense this this need primarily one of the primary"
ah what we say motivation of developing or development of this distributed systems so"
we will we will ah break for now and we will continue our discussion in the subsequent"
in the next lecture thank you"

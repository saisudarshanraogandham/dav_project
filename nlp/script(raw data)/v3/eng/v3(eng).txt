on basic or foundation of these cloud computing and then go into the more detail so as we
were discussing yesterday or in the last class rather that that n i s t defined ah cloud
computing how n i s t define the cloud computing model as a enabling ubiquitous convenient
on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources this is
point to be noted so that means there is a shared pool of resource
which can be configured as per demand so that can be rapidly provision that means ah it
can be provisions to realize something and released or when i dont require it can be
released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction that means whenever
a customer or the user or the ah service consumer ah needs it can provision whenever it does
he ah it the no requirement is there it can de provisioned and thats exactly the pay as
you go model if you look at the essential characteristics
as we have already seen some of the things they what we required it is a on demand cell
surface that is a service which is on demand and ah its a on demand cell surface broad
network access this is important thing that means i should have a appropriate network
access because ah resources are distributed they are at different geographical location
they are being pooled and provision to the user there is another thing is the resource
pooling that means i can basically pooled resources into the and that that gives us
a a multi tenant model with different physical and virtual resource dynamical assign like
i i a ah from the same service provider i want to have a say windows system windows
subsystem with so many hardware specification and this are the different software specificationfrom
the same service providers somebody is having say a a linux say ubuntu subsystem ah and
one two realize those resources on the things so this sort of resource pooling and management
of the resources ah is important aspects of the thing there is another characteristics
any type of services are measured services right in a say that means i pay for what i
use so whatever i am using is being measured ah so this is a measured services and another
important aspects is rapid elasticity that means i can go up down as and when requirement
is there like a if i take a example like i i am running a simulation and i need a something
ah a four g b sort of ram and when it is ah when we are when while running the things
more data comes or more application load is there i want to increase the ram to four g
b to eight g b right so i need to i need to ah for some some portion
of the time i need to have a ah bring more resources so that should i i will be able
to rapidly provisioning and not only that this type of elasticity is should be there
it should be i can go up come down when i requirement is there so that should be one
of the important characteristics of property of cloud there are several ah common characteristics
ah which are which are what we say that typically a cloud compute exact form or cloud service
provider so provide one is as we have discussed massive scale up and down resilient computing
homogeneity like i dont care that how weather at the back in that heterogeneous resources
are there i want to have a homogeneous thing typical one characteristics is that they are
usually the resources many geographically are geographically ah spread or geographically
geographic distribution one major aspect is virtualization so i virtualize
the think so i i virtaulize a windows over a linux say there is a that sort of thing
or i have a infrastructure over there virtaulize several ah virtual machines and work on it
i can have different applications i work on it and type of things so that is one important
aspect rather in subsequent lectures we will look little bit more on this virtualization
aspect there is a important aspect of service orientation so it is it is the services which
are being ah communicating with the which other rather than its a data driven so it
is not data orientation more of a service orientation there can be different type of
services so if we we will see that in a service oriented architecture
so ah like ah we we can have a service service provider there can be a service consumer and
there is a registry service or what we say somewhere some catalogue so the consumer talks
to the or look at look up to the registry and find that what are the services are there
appropriately collect to the ah provider to ah access the service right and service provider
whenever it is having more or this is different service provider its a basically a bunch of
represent a bunch of service provider jump bunch of consumer and its a distributed but
some of logically centralized ah ah registry or catalogue and this service provider with
basically upload update the registry in the things it is as if ah i can have a analogy
like this is the telephone directory type of thing where i have different type of yellow
pages and other thing and if whenever i required some to something to search starting from
a particular person to particular type of activity like i want to look for a ah say
home delivery services so i look at the things are over the home
delivery services and then connect to that thing by a telephone call right so this is
somewhere a catalogue or registry service consume or service provider and consumer this
over all its a some sort of a service oriented architecture right so that will again we will
see little bit more that what are the different type of service oriented so one of the major
aspects of this cloud computing is to realize service oriented architecture
there is it may it it usually have a low cost software in the sense like at as this is being
used and it is a multi tenant type of things the overall costing of the software comes
down for the consumer end right and expected to give a advance security there are different
concerned about security we will discuss some of the things but expect to have a constant
on the security it is not only security in terms of whether somebody is bridging the
security on things some of the things like i say that the if the data is in cloud it
is expected that the data is not lost right but if it is ah if it is ah it is in my own
system so it is my responsibility to set the system
ah keep the ah system up and things similarly some application i am say a mail application
on the cloud so it is expected that this is more stable and type of things whereas if
i am having my own mail server and mail relay etcetera then it is my maintenance and it
goes on things so there are different aspects of the things so it it is like it is supposed
to provide a advance security features with respect to access control with respect to
different resilient or blocking of different attach in a with respect to data reservation
or no data lost type of situation and type of things right so if you look at the typical
cloud service model we will go into more details ah subsequently so one as we immediately look
at is the software as a service right so what we see the capability to provide consumer
to use providers application running on cloud infrastructure
like we are nowadays using different type of things different type of aspects like say
what processing a spread sheet on on the internet right even there are different if you those
who are use to scientific ah technical writing etcetera using tools likely i take etcetera
we are having things called which are on the web so that means those those applications
are somewhere yields on the cloud ah and we we we want to hook into that application and
then use those application and get my data either stored in my own the local machine
or at times the data is stored in some other data service provider right
so that means what you require is a basic minimal way of interfacing to the external
cloud right and gets that the software as a service now the softwares must be running
as some some system or must be compiling or compiled on some platform as a user i am not
bothered about it right and what i say that for using the system what i require a basic
interface may be a in sort of a web browser like say mozilla internet explorer chrome
and etcetera etcetera so and and i have a basic and i have the knowledge
to how the use the software it can be a what processer it can be a scientific simulator
it can be a text processing it can be a some other type of applications right a mathematical
application or type of things so ah so this is as a software as a service so what i am
getting the service i am getting as a software that so that makes lot of convenience at my
end i dont have to purchase that software neither i have to maintain the updates neither
i have to look at that how much my hardware requirement to run the software in some of
the software there may be hardware requirement much higher but my application is not that
large so my i so that scaling of the software becomes the responsibility
so this is the software as a service another thing is that infrastructure as a service
so that means i i want to realize some infrastructure at my end right so that is that is the infrastructure
as a as a service like i want to realize a machine of particular specification like i
say it should be a it should have some four g b ram so much megahertz processor and so
much hard disk right so this is a infrastructure as if i am realizing the whole system on my
desk right so that if i again if i what i have i can have different ah a simple ah and
i can i can basically have this infrastructure as i want today i require a four g b ram tomorrow
i require a sixty four g b ram for some work next day i require a two g b ram i dont know
i want to only to some basic operation so usually when i have this type of very ah
variable requirements or type of things i can basically provision that the infrastructure
so there are provider who provides infrastructure as a service right in between this two ah
i a s infrastructure as a service and software as a service we have another stuff call platform
as a service right so it provides a platform for some development work some using some
test cases and other thing so i i require so one is that software i am using another
things is that i have the infrastructure i load ways i or the row ways can come with
the infrastructure i load other application then run and test and other things otherwise
i require that platform as a service right so there are service provider who provide
platform as a service type of models so this allows me to use as a platform so these are
three very prominent ah what we say ah service model of cloud there are other various service
model rather like data as a service which which keep the data even people are talking
about whether i can have something like science as a service like i give different scientific
tools etcetera and then you work on on a particular particular revenue on the type of things and
looking other things or what we say it is a something anything as a service or x a a
s type of things it typical cloud philosophy wants to make this x e is a realization anything
as a service type of model so ah if we if we look at this over all step
so what we have at the below is the basic infrastructure this is and over that this
is platform as a service and over there there are software as a services right and there
can be different type of infrastructure like we can say that virtual machine many be one
infrastructure servers storage load balancer network these are the different type of infrastructures
right and there can be different other type of infrastructure as you can feel so i can
have external devices and other things has a infrastructure and type of things which
can be ah pulled in over that when we look at the platform as a service there is more
of a something execution platform on runtime database is web server development tool development
platform there can be some sort of a cell box type of environment and type of things
so these are a more as a platform as a service and over that i have a saas or the software
as a service which basically realize the ah this softwares likes there can be s r m email
different virtual desktop there are different games and so on things which runs over the
over and above the this cloud infrastructure and paas now how where the so this this part
is more of the cloud provider end so some provider may provide saas some may provide
paas some may provide saas ah i a s or what we say infrastructure service some may provide
a mix of the things right but if we look at the client perspective so how client access
it so the ah the best or the what we say the universal way is the web browser right or
what we say web client there are other things like an i can have mobile apps right which
can access this type of a thing i even there are thin clients the terminal emulator and
different type of other thing so these are the interface by which the client
interface to the to this cloud right now if if we with this thing if we want to look at
the different type of deployment models right so what are the different type of deploy how
to realize those cloud or type of clouds right one is the private cloud i build a cloud and
i use it like in our i i t kharagpur with we indigenously with open source systems we
build a cloud called meghamala so it is name of the cloud is meghamala its a very not so
large cloud but is privately build on over source system primarily used by researchers
ah both faculty and research scholars for mostly a infrastructure as a service over
the things over that we try to give other services like
data services or other type of big data services and type of things but primarily its a infrastructure
as a service so its a private cloud it is accessible within the i i t kharagpur network
itself and not not accessible outside the network right and it it has a different charging
model like as it is a institute funded infrastructure ah so we dont charge anything on things there
can be others other end a what we say public cloud right so that means which is public
ah so at different type of things i can have public clouds as infrastructure i can have
five bit clouds as like amazon ah clouds are for infrastructure for a one of the popular
example there can be platform as a service type of cloud like what we look at some sort
of a what we say that microsoft azure or we can have things like software as a service
type of cloud like google doc tools spreadsheets type of things some of the examples
so these are the public clouds right there are another things what i can have a hybrid
cloud right so it is a mix of things of public and private as such there is a typical category
of cloud which is a what we say community cloud so it is something semi semi public
semi private type of things like i can have ah it is shared by several organization and
support specific goals or what we say coat un coat it say some sort of a likeminded or
like like i means same same type of goal achieving organization
like i say bank bank sector may have a banking cloud right so that core banking things whatever
they exchange with the things in our county like r b i may be the nodal agency to handle
or the things over that there is a cloud i can have a institutional cloud like what we
have say government funded institutional cloud which can work on the things i can have there
are things like if i working with some other type of data like bank etcetera like one like
what we work on in the spatial data we can have a jeo special cloud which with the type
of things so this is addressed to a community may not
be a not in a one organization multiple organization but it it has some purpose to do right so
this is a community cloud now i can have a hybrid or the things some private some public
some community or public private only and type of things right so these are the different
type of what we say deployment models of the cloud now ah though we will go little ah more
differ into the things is subsequent lectures but we can do see that the cloud and this
virtualization somewhat come hand in hand right so ah if we if we look at this picture
which we say there virtualized or virtualization stack so we have a bare metal of the hardware
at the end right over that i require a something a middleware which allows me to create different
virtual things so what we are trying to see like ah what
we are saying that we are having different hardware right it can be it can be different
systems across different network etcetera and connected through different sort of network
etcetera over that what i i am end goal is to realize different virtual machine like
i can say this is a sixteen g b machine of of running windows this is a maybe sixty four
g b machine ram with running something some orient of linux etcetera right now this collectively
being realized to make this type of different virtual machines right so i require something
in between what we say v m m or virtual machine monitor or hyper visor
so this hyper visor basically allows me to emulate this different type of machines so
if we look at the virtualization stack so one or virtualization how how i want to what
we want to virtualize one is that virtual works basis i can have different virtual works
basis and abstraction of an execution environment that can be made dynamically available to
the authorized clients by using well defined protocol so i i suppose for my particular
project i require a environment for this may be development environment visualization environment
computing environment and then i i generate dynamically or the organization generate dynamically
to the for the team to work on it right and that may be a short term project of fourteen
days or something and it basically realized purchasing a whole ah stuff for that fourteen
days maybe a costly affair but if i provision that from external world on a pay you or from
public cloud and maybe a solution right so there is only another thing aspect is the
virtual machine on to realize into the into different virtual machines and then there
are there can be different category of virtual machines which can be used by the user like
as a talking about meghamala we realize different category of virtual machines with poetically
basically three category of virtual machines and whenever use a needs come we provision
it based on the availability of the things and it can provide infrastructure a p i plug
ins to hardware support infrastructure etcetera so it can provide it provides a p i to connect
to the different infrastructure so we will basically look at visualization there are
different aspect of virtualization so that we will look at in the subsequent lectures
so if we just look at this whatever you are talking about so virtual machine technology
allows multiple virtual machine to run a single physical machine
so this is my hardware so it is not that single physical machine means not only one machine
there can be couple of machine clubbed together and realized like i say that i have ten four
g b systems or ah so that i can have some effectively forty g b things and then i realize
say three or two sixteen g b and one eight g b actually you cannot do all division there
are some some requirement to for for this virtualize to happen so it forty g b can you
break into two sixteen g b and so i realize two sixteen g b machine using underlining
this hardware right so so what we require is one is the virtual machine monitor which
allows me to ah emulate this hardware and i can have different virtual machines over
the things and there are a concept of guest ways which resize on the things right
so there the guest ways here may be linux there can be other guest ways there can be
other guest ways and different type of things and this applications running on the things
are different and this virtual machine by may be used by somebody at some geographical
location this virtual machine somebody at the some other geographical location and so
on and so forth so everybody for individual consumer its say its say machine for its purpose
so there are different category of virtualization we will see the things like a performance
for virtualization close to row physical performance we will see that why and how and later on
so ah some of the popular virtual machine monitor or hypervisor is one is xen another
is v m ware so virtualization in general there are advantages
of the virtual machines like run operating system where the physical hardware is unavailable
easier to create new machine backup machine etcetera software testing using clean install
etcetera there are of ah number of things which are which can be realized with this
virtual machine so ah so there are there are issues of cloud sourcing when we are why why
it is becoming important first of all high scale low cost providers so i can have lot
of resources as a think so economy party play a ah important role right when you get the
much cheaper services on the things etcetera we will see in a separate lecture that whether
ah whether this ah economy is always what what this cloud economics of cloud says and
whether always it is a beneficial or hm we need to think about there when the things
are beneficial etcetera anytime anyplace access via web browser so
it is my whole computing my hold services whatever i am exercising is anytime anyplace
type of services right so i dont bother about that where the services un leverage and type
of things and there are rapid scalability incremental cost and load sharing so there
is a scalability is pretty high right i can rapidly scale scalable that is ah cant forget
need to focus on local i ts so that the whatever your infrastructure is there that need to
be looked into there are some of the serious concerns also whenever you are leveraging
or resources from a things one major concern is performance reliability and service level
agreements right what will be the performance what will be the reliability the service is
always on and type of things and there are issues of service reliable agreements like
i i signs some agreement with the things whether these those are honoured not honoured and
type of things there are issues of concern of data and service
parameters like i say concern of the data my my data is in cloud even i write a later
the later is in the cloud i write a report there is in the cloud then i am concerned
that whether this data is secured should not be tampered and so far and another issue is
there service parameter this is also there like ah how do they say that the ah availability
is ninety percent or ninety five percent how to look at those parameter how to audit that
that whatever i looked for is given by the things right
there are issues or application features and choices so its its its ah sometimes we say
that its provides a application which is fix all right whether i i dont have a customized
choice of the thing whether there a issues there whether i can have or not there issues
of interaction between cloud providers right so there are one provider purchasing services
from the thing like it may be a infrastructure provider purchasing some of the infrastructure
like hardware etcetera from a data provider and so on and so forth
no standard or like issue of standardization of the a p is like whether it is a soap or
rest type of services when we look at the service oriented architecture and of course
issues of security privacy security compliance trust competence risk these are the ah major
concern whenever we purchase this sort of a service especially it is critical when we
purchase those things for our some of the machine critical or my day today operational
requirement cloud storage why why we keep it separate because it is place a ah pretty
important role we will if time permits we will look at that some of the storage aspects
but it it say it say one of the important factor because data is extremely important
for the for the consumer or for the service consumer or the users right
so allow data stored remotely to be temporarily cached on the desktop computers mobile phones
or other internet linked device so you you can have a sinking with the data also many
of us are using this sort of services ah for ah putting our data as a service so there
are ah things like amazon e c two s s three are well known examples where where this data
services are there some of the advantages just to re iterate one is the lower computer
cost right ah one major aspects ah there is low i should say not computer cost lower computing
cost improved performance i expect that the overall
performance will be improved because i am purchasing something as a higher price reduced
software of course like i dont have to purchase separate software etcetera instance software
updates if there is a update this is getting updated improve document format compatibility
if there are interoperability you should be a prop ah better you addressed
unlimited theoretically unlimited storage i pay and i get the storage increase data
reliability i it is stored in distributed things with proper redundancy etcetera so
it is expected the data it will be high universe and information access i can access information
at every point latest version of the systems and software available easier group collaboration
when you are having one data different applications device independent i can access from different
type of devices required say there are obviously some these are all good points there are always
some pit faults or some concerns or disadvantages like requires a constant internet connection
you are disconnected your gone does not work well with low speed connection
that is again network connectivity feature might be limited right so some of the things
i may not get what i get on a on a customized personal thing at can be slow at time because
this is provisioning etcetera finally takes time stored data i am really we are nearly
concerned about whether how securities stored data can be lost if there is a crash on the
things or the provider goes out of the things that there may be chance of loss for cloud
is not truly a high performance computing systems so we so if we think that cloud will
provide ah high performance with may not provide there h p c type of things and there are several
general concept or connectivity of a p i s having particular database connectivity where
the database will run etcetera so what will do we will stop here and for
now and then we will look at the different architecture and in my in our sub subsequent
lectures thank you
